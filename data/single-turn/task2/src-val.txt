Early life Galileo Galilei was born in Pisa, Italy, on February 15, 1564, the first child of Vincenzio Galilei, a merchant and a musician, and Giulia Ammannati. The family moved to Florence, Italy, in 1574. That year Galileo started his formal education in the nearby monastery (house for people who have taken religious vows) of Vallombrosa. Seven years later he studied medicine at the University of Pisa. In 1583 Galileo developed new interests and began his studies in mathematics and physics, which ended his medical studies. In Pisa at that time there was only one notable science teacher, Francisco Buonamico, who taught the ideas of Aristotle (c. 384–c. 322 B.C.E. ). Galileo seems to have been an eager follower of Buonamico, as shown by Galileo's Juvenilia, dating from 1584, which mostly describes Aristotle's scientific ideas. Because of financial difficulties, Galileo had to leave the University of Pisa in 1585 before earning his degree. Early work Back in Florence, Galileo searched for a teaching position and continued to study mathematics and physics. He published two works that made his name well known. One was The Little Balance, describing the hydrostatic (relating to the forces produced by fluids at rest) principles of balancing; the other was a study of the center of gravity of various solids. His rising reputation gained him a teaching post at the University of Pisa in 1589. Galileo had to support his mother, brothers, and sisters after his father's death in 1591, so he found a better position in 1592 at the University of Padua, part of the Venetian Republic. In 1604 Galileo declared that he was a supporter of the theory of Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543), who stated that the earth and other planets revolved around the sun. In 1606 the publication of The Operations of the Geometrical and Military Compass, revealed Galileo's skill with experiments. In this booklet he also defended himself against criticism from several sources. In mid-1609 Galileo learned about the success of some Dutch eyeglass makers when they combined several lenses into what later would be called a telescope (an instrument for viewing distant objects). He went right to work, and on August 25 he presented to the Venetian Senate a telescope as his own invention. This led the University of Padua to give him a lifetime contract, but resentment followed when it was learned that Galileo was not the original inventor. Astronomical works Galileo's telescope had a magnifying power of about forty. Sometime in the fall of 1609 he turned the telescope toward the sky. Within a few months Galileo had gathered astonishing evidence about mountains on the moon, about moons circling the planet Jupiter, and about an incredibly large number of stars. In March of 1610 all these sensational items were printed in Venice, Italy, under the title The Starry Messenger, a booklet that took the world of science by storm. The view of the heavens changed greatly, and so did Galileo's life. Galileo was very ambitious and decided to secure a position for himself as a mathematics expert in Florence at the court of Cosimo II. In 1610 he left his wife, Marina Gamba, and his family behind in Padua. In 1612 his Discourse on Bodies in Water was published. In it he revealed his discovery of the phases of the planet Venus, but this work was also the source of heated disputes. In 1613 Galileo published his observations of sunspots (dark spots that appear on the sun's surface from time to time), which led to bitter arguments with Christopher Scheiner (1573–  1650) of the University of Ingolstadt, Germany, whose observations of sunspots had already been published in 1612. Condemned by the Church Galileo's real aim was to publish a complete description of the universe and of the new physics it required. A major problem was that many people believed that, according to the Bible, the sun and other planets moved around a motionless earth. With the help of some religious experts, Galileo produced essays explaining and defending his point of view in the form of letters, which ranked among the best religious writings of those times. As the letters circulated widely, a showdown with Church authorities seemed certain. In 1616 the Church ordered Galileo not to hold, teach, and defend in any manner whatsoever, in words or in print the theory of Copernicus regarding the motion of the Earth. Galileo obeyed the order partly to make life easier for himself and partly because he remained a devoted Catholic. In 1624, though, after meeting with Pope Urban VIII (1568–1644) and sensing that anger over his writings had lessened, Galileo decided to pursue his work again. Galileo spent six years writing his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. Published in 1632, it contains criticism of the supposed perfection of the universe as claimed by Aristotle. It discusses how the rotation of the earth helps explain different occurrences in space. The orbital motion of the earth around the sun is also debated. The Dialogue was a huge success. The fact that some of his ideas opposed each other did not take away from the popularity of the work. Condemned again The Dialogue proved that Galileo held, taught, and defended the theories of Copernicus, so he was called back to Rome to appear before Church leaders. The proceedings lasted from the fall of 1632 to the summer of 1633. During that time Galileo was allowed to stay at the home of the Florentine representative to Rome. He was never subjected to physical threats. However, he was finally ordered to publicly renounce (state that he did not believe) the idea that the Earth moved. Galileo was then confined under house arrest to his home in Arcetri, Italy. He was not allowed to have any visitors nor have any of his works printed outside of Italy. Both orders were ignored. In 1634 a French translation of one of his old papers on mechanics (the study of forces and their effect on matter) was published, and in Holland the Dialogue was published in Latin in 1635. Later years In 1638 Galileo's Two New Sciences was printed in Leiden, Holland. It gave a geometrical (relating to points, lines, angles, and surfaces) description of motion, partly because such an approach led to a close match with known data. Galileo believed that the universe was structured along the patterns of geometry, the product of a Creator who had planned everything according to weight, measure, and number. This religious belief is possibly Galileo's greatest quality. It was best stated in the Dialogue, when he described the human mind as being the most excellent product of the Creator because it could recognize mathematical truths. Galileo spent his last years partially blind. He died on January 8, 1642. <SP> Galileo <S> biology.owned_animal biology.pedigreed_animal sports.racehorse biology.organism <S> Galileo (foaled 30 March 1998) is a retired Irish Thoroughbred racehorse and active sire.

It continued publishing through 1931. It was the first working-class newspaper in Chicago to last for a significant period, and sustained itself primarily through reader funding; the reader-owners removed several editors over its run due to disagreements over editorial policies. The Arbeiter-Zeitung was initially edited by German-American émigrés Paul Grottkau and August Spies. Grottkau departed for Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1883 to establish the Milwaukee Arbeiter Zeitung, leaving the Chicago paper in the hands of Spies, who was officially named editor in 1884. In the early months of 1886, membership in Chicago Internationals swelled to record levels while the Arbeiter-Zeitung and the anarchist publication the Alarm unleashed a steady stream of editorials railing against capitalism. Labor leaders focused on the eight-hour work day as the means to a better life for working people. The newspaper complained that as wealthy businessmen lived opulently, workers suffered and unemployment rose.

The group released two albums for Capitol Records, but was largely unsuccessful and split in 1977. After the first album, Mooney was replaced by Hunt Sales, who had also played with Rundgren. Initially the band's sound was rock-oriented, but later developed towards funk, and represented a departure from Welch's work with Fleetwood Mac. A third album was planned, but Sales fell ill and the band split. Songs from the aborted third Paris album were used for Welch's first solo album, French Kiss, and the deal with Capitol was converted into a solo album deal for Welch. After Paris split up, Welch launched a successful solo career, and Sales worked with Iggy Pop and later Tin Machine with David Bowie. British-born Cornick moved to the US where, after a decade out of the music business, he reformed his band Wild Turkey in the 1990s.

The word tār means string in Persian, though it might have the same meaning in languages influenced by Persian. This has led some Iranian experts to hold that the Tar must be common among all the Iranian people as well as the territories that are boldly named as Iranian Cultural Continent by the Encyclopædia Iranica. This is claimed to be the root of the names of the Persian setar and the guitar as well as less widespread instruments such as the dutar and the Indian sitar. Though it was certainly developed in the Persian Empire, the exact region in which it was first made and played in the Persian Empire cannot be confirmed. Tar is one of the most important musical instruments in Iran and the Caucasus. The formation, compilation, edition, and inheritance of the most authentic and most comprehensive versions of radif are all worked on tar. The general trends of Persian classical music have been deeply influenced by tar players. <SP> Tar <S> commerce.product music.instrument music.performance_role <S> A tar is a single-headed frame drum.

There are tar, bendir, bodhran, deff, duff, and many others. Many Native American cultures use the frame drum in ceremony and celebration. These drums seem simple, but are capable of great nuance and sophistication.

At age 13 in 1990 he made the first ever known Star Wars fan film using action figures and shot blue screen and special effects after renting out a local TV station. At age 14 he wrote Robin Hood: Prince of Sherwood and with the help of his father and friends, pulled together his first feature film, shot on 16mm. The film took three years to make and premiered in January 1994 at the local town theater. Tickets were sold at $5 and around 3,000 people saw the movie over 2 days. That same year, Hunter began his second feature film attempt at age 17, this time playing the lead role as well as directing. Also shot and edited on 16mm, The River Bridge was completed in 1996. This film starred Charles Napier, a veteran character actor of the 80s and 90s. In 1997, Hunter married and moved to Los Angeles where he studied film, theater, and philosophy at Los Angeles City College. He worked at the Virgin Mega Store in Hollywood, as a waiter at Hamburger Hamlet, and as an extra to make ends. Due to the Digital Revolution and Hollywood's reluctance to take such a young director seriously, Hunter put directing aside and got involved in acting at age 20 and in 2004 he became a member of the Screen Actors Guild. His teenage films remained on a shelf until 2008 when Hunter distributed the movies with the help of Ryan Sims, and the films were finally released through Indieflix and Amazon.com. In April of 2013, Hunter uploaded to films to YouTube. Born and raised in Alabama, Hunter moved to Los Angeles to pursue his film career in 1997 where he still resides.

Our goal, as an early-stage drug development organization, is to execute a business plan unique within the pharmaceutical industry: to rapidly and efficiently generate medically important, stable, long-acting bio-therapeutics, which are then available for sale, license or further partner-funded development following early-stage demonstration of safety and proof of concept in man.   At CoGenesys, we are applying a proprietary and clinically validated technology that allows the improvement and expanded use of many known and clinically established therapeutic peptides and proteins as well as the creation of new medicines from known pharmaceutically relevant peptides. Without the benefit of our technology, these peptides and proteins have numerous shortcomings including poor bio-availability, the need for frequent dosing, and unwanted side-effect profiles.   CoGenesys’ highly experienced management and development teams have a significant track record in translating early drug opportunities into clinically-proven candidates for the pharmaceutical market. Our state of the art research and manufacturing facility is fully equipped, supporting both GLP development and cGMP manufacture of biologics. We have capitalized on the depth of our pipeline and the breadth of our technology to develop drug candidates that will address a broad spectrum of unmet needs including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and enzyme replacement therapy, among others. We currently have several well-advanced product development programs including our lead clinical candidate Cardeva, a long-acting natriuretic peptide being developed for outpatient treatment of chronic heart failure. The second program, Neugranin, a long-acting form of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF), is being readied for clinical development as an agent initially for the treatment of febrile neutropenia associated with chemotherapy.

A detective chief inspector from 2006 is investigating a serial killer when he is knocked over by a speeding car. Waking up, he finds himself apparently in 1973. Is he mad, in a coma, or has he travelled back in time? Initially struggling to come to terms with his situation, Sam Tyler has to come to terms with the old-fashioned technology and attitudes of the day, convinced that, if he can find out how he came to be trapped in the past, he can find the way home. The actor John Simm described the show as a cross between Back to the Future and The Sweeney. It makes effective use of the disorientation of the unwitting time-traveller while taking a post-modern romp through 1970s fashions and technologies, with due tribute paid to the c&#108assic police dramas of the day, to fashion a truly unique programme. A sequel series, Ashes to Ashes, followed in 2008.

What was responsible for the death of John Anderson? <SP> John Anderson <S> ratings.rated_entity film.director biology.organism event.agent tv.actor film.actor media_common.cataloged_instance music.artist people.deceased_person people.person <S> A tall, sinewy, austere-looking character actor with silver hair, rugged features and a distinctive voice, John Robert Anderson left an impressive legacy of literally hundreds of film and TV credits. Immensely versatile, he was at his best submerging himself in the role of historical figures (he impersonated Abraham Lincoln three times and twice baseball commissioner Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, men whom he strongly resembled). He was a familiar presence in westerns and science-fiction serials, usually as upstanding, dignified and generally benign citizens (a rare exception was his Ebonite interrogator in The Outer Limits (1963) episode Nightmare). He had a high opinion of Rod Serling and was proud to be featured in four episodes of The Twilight Zone (1959), most memorably as the tuxedo-clad angel Gabriel in A Passage for Trumpet (doing for Jack Klugman what Henry Travers did for James Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life (1946)). Known to other youths as 'J.R.', Anderson had a happy childhood, growing up first on a small farm near Clayton, Illinois, and then in the mid-sized town of Quincy where his mother operated a cigar stand. A rangy, outdoorsy type, he excelled at various sports, was a drum major, a member of the track team and the boy scouts. During World War II, he served in the Coast Guard, mainly involved in helping protect convoys from U-boat attacks. In 1946, he commenced studies at the University of Iowa, eventually graduating with a master's degree in drama. His acting career began on the riverboat 'Goldenrod' (now the oldest surviving Mississippi River Basin showboat in America) and proceeded from there to the Cleveland Playhouse for a year, then the New York stage and summer stock with parts in prestigious plays like Cat On A Hot Tin Roof and Home of the Brave. He also occasionally doubled up as a singer on Broadway (Paint Your Wagon (1951), The Emperor's Clothes (1953)). Anderson began as a regular television actor during that medium's formative years. In the course of the next four decades, his appearance barely changing, he was consistently excellent wherever he popped up, be it as western lawmen (including a recurring role as Virgil Earp in The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp (1955)), as cops, governors, judges and army officers; hard-nosed oil executive Herbert Styles in Dallas (1978), or as kindly patriarch of the Hazard clan in North and South (1985). Though less traveled on the big screen, Anderson was particularly impressive as the furtive second-hand car dealer, 'California Charlie', in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), the ruthless leader of the renegades, Addis, in Day of the Evil Gun (1968) and, reprising his role as Lincoln, in The Lincoln Conspiracy (1977).
