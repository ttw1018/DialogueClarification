Because of its location near the northwest limb of the Moon's near side, this crater is viewed at a relatively low angle from the Earth resulting in foreshortening and limiting the amount of detail that can be seen. This is an isolated formation, making it relatively easy to find. The nearest craters of note are Gerard, farther to the west, and von Braun to the west-southwest. To the northeast of Harding is the smaller crater Dechen. The rim of Harding has a sharp edge, and is not quite circular, with slight outward bulges to the north and west, and a somewhat angular corner in the southeast. The inner walls have slumped down, producing a ring of material around the interior floor. There is a slight ridge at the midpoint.

What is Hurricane Klaus affecting area <SP> Hurricane Klaus <S> meteorology.tropical_cyclone <S> Hurricane Klaus was a North Atlantic hurricane that hit the Leeward Islands from the west in November of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming from a broad area of low pressure on November 5, Klaus maintained a northeast movement throughout much of its path. After making landfall on extreme eastern Puerto Rico, it passed to the north of the Leeward Islands, resulting in strong southwesterly winds and rough seas. Klaus attained hurricane status and reached peak winds of 90 mph (145 km/h) before becoming extratropical over cooler waters on November 13. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico, causing minor flooding and light damage. Klaus caused heavy marine damage in the Leeward Islands, including wrecking at least three ships. The Virgin Islands experienced heavy damage as well. <SP> Hurricane Klaus <S> time.event meteorology.tropical_cyclone <S> Hurricane Klaus was a minimal Atlantic hurricane that dropped heavy rainfall across the Lesser Antilles in October 1990. The eleventh tropical cyclone and sixth hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season, Klaus developed from a tropical wave on October 3 a short distance east of Dominica. It drifted northwestward, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status on October 5. Though its closest approach to the Lesser Antilles was within 12 miles (19 km), the strongest winds remained to its northeast due to strong wind shear, which caused Klaus to steadily weaken. After deteriorating into a tropical depression, Klaus briefly restrengthened over the Bahamas before dissipating on October 9 under the influence of developing tropical storm, Marco.

What is Piano Sonata No. 2's musical scale <SP> Piano Sonata No. 2 <S> music.composition media_common.creative_work media_common.cataloged_instance ratings.rated_entity <S> Scriabin's Piano Sonata No. 2 in G-sharp minor, took five years for him to write. It was finally published in 1898, at the urging of his publisher. The piece is in two movements, with a style combining Chopin-like Romanticism with an impressionistic touch. The piece is widely appreciated and is one of Scriabin's more popular pieces. The first movement Andante begins with echoing effects, followed by two lyrically themed sections. After a short climax, the piece modulates to E major and lyrical sections are restated with a slightly more complicated accompaniment. The second movement Presto, in sharp contrast to the first movement, is very fast and intense. In fact, at the given tempo indication, the second movement averages nearly 15 notes per second, making it comparable to an 茅tude. Alternating crescendos and decrescendos may give the listener the impression of waves. The precedent of Beethoven's 'Moonlight' Sonata allowed Scriabin the luxury of an opening slow movement to his Second Sonata, whose programme reads thus: The first section represents the quiet of a southern night on the seashore; the development is the dark agitation of the deep, deep sea. <SP> Piano Sonata No. 2 <S> media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work media_common.dedicated_work music.composition ratings.rated_entity <S> The Piano Sonata No. 2 in F-sharp minor, Op. 2 of Johannes Brahms was written in Hamburg, Germany in 1852, and published the year after. Despite being his second published work, it was actually composed before his first piano sonata, but was published later because Brahms recognized the importance of an inaugural publication and felt that the C major sonata was of higher quality. It was sent along with his first sonata to Breitkopf und H盲rtel with a letter of recommendation from Robert Schumann. Schumann had already praised Brahms enthusiastically, and the sonata shows signs of an effort to impress, with its technical demands and highly dramatic nature. It was dedicated to Clara Schumann. The sonata is in four movements: Allegro non troppo, ma energico Andante con espressione Scherzo: Allegro -- Poco pi霉 moderato Finale: Sostenuto -- Allegro non troppo e rubato -- Molto sostenuto The first movement is in the conventional sonata-allegro form. The second movement is a theme and variations based on the German Minnesang Mir ist leide. Like the theme and variations of the first sonata, the variations move from the minor mode to the parallel major.

It was the ninth named storm, third typhoon and the second super-typhoon of the 2011 Pacific typhoon season. The low-pressure area which became the typhoon originally formed on 23 July. It gradually drifted to the west, becoming a tropical depression. As it turned north and neared the Philippines it rapidly strengthened, becoming a Category 5 typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. In the Philippines, the storm claimed eight lives and caused much damage.

Its maximum depth is 215 meters. It is drained by the Seton River, which feeds Seton Lake and so the Fraser River. It is fed by the Gates River, which drains from the Pemberton Pass divide with the Birkenhead River valley towards Pemberton-Mount Currie. It and Seton Lake were originally the same lake, which was cut in half between ten and twenty thousand years ago by a large landslide from the north face of the Cayoosh Range, which fronts Anderson Lake on the east. The slide created a locality known today as Seton Portage, which combined with the steamer Lady of The Lake played a key role on the route of the Douglas Road during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858-59. At its head, near the mouth of the Gates River, is the community of D'Arcy, the St'at'imcets name for which is N'quatqua.

Mario is 10 years old, mute and with limited hearing, and openly worships his older brother Simon, an 18-year-old about to discover the first romantic interest of his life. Mario depends on Simon all the more because their parents are busy on the island during the tourist season, leaving their youngest son on his own. Although Mario manages to survive Simon's preference for the young woman he meets -- she will not be there forever -- an accident intervenes in the brothers' relationship and is the cause of enormous change in Mario's life. The brothers try to adjust as best they can, for it appears as though Mario will have to leave for the mainland and live in a special home for the hearing and voice impaired. The setting, music, and performances are excellent in this slightly uneven story.
To which relgion does Peter Robinson belong? <SP> Peter Robinson <S> computer.computer_scientist education.academic people.person <S> Peter Robinson is Professor of Computer Technology in the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where he leads the Rainbow Research Group working on computer graphics and interaction. Professor Robinson's research concerns problems at the boundary between people and computers. This involves investigating new technologies to enhance communication between computers and their users, and new applications to exploit these technologies. The main focus for this is human-computer interaction, where he has been leading work for some years on the use of video and paper as part of the user interface. The idea is to develop augmented environments in which everyday objects acquire computational properties through user interfaces based on video projection and digital cameras. Recent work has included desk-size projected displays and tangible interfaces. With rapid advances in key computing technologies and the heightened user expectation of computers, the development of socially and emotionally adept technologies is becoming a necessity. He has led investigations of the inference of people's mental states from facial expressions, vocal nuances, body posture and gesture, and other physiological signals, and also considered the expression of emotions by robots and cartoon avatars. He has also pursued a parallel line of research into inclusive user interfaces. Collaboration with the Engineering Design Centre has investigated questions of physical handicap, and research students have considered visual handicaps. This has broader applications for interaction with ubiquitous computers, where the input and output devices themselves impose limitations. <SP> Peter Robinson <S> people.person people.deceased_person media_common.cataloged_instance government.politician event.agent biology.organism ratings.rated_entity <S> In 2008, this Northern Irish politician became both the leader of his country's Democratic Unionist Party and the First Minister of Northern Ireland.

This church came to be known as the First Colored Baptist Church of Shreveport. The original building was dedicated on August 18, 1871. In the late 1800s, the church bought land on Texas Avenue and began construction of a new church. As the church was being built, a storm destroyed the entire structure. The leaders of the First Colored Baptist Church decided to rebuild the structure at a cost of $3,198.45. This new church, designed by Nathaniel Sykes Allen, was dedicated at 1057 Texas Avenue in 1903. Soon after its dedication, the church was renamed Union Missionary Baptist Church. Finally, the church was renamed once more, to Antioch Baptist Church. The structure is built of red brick and white trim. The church became a member of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. in 1906. The church has been renovated two times since its original dedication, in 1943 and 1958 respectively.

All the classic elements are here -- there's the villainous bookmaker (Alfred Hemming) who wants to fix a horse race and ruin the romance between the hero, Hubert Brancaster (Irving Cummings) and the heroine, Diana Beverly (Alma Hanlon). The villain is helped in his schemes by the worldly Mrs. D'Aquila (June Elvidge), while her lover, Baron Satoris (Paul McAllister) betrays the jockey's sister, Myrtle (Jean Dumar). Myrtle has perhaps the best title card in this silent: when Baron Satoris proposes that her brother (Dion Titheradge) throw the race, she indignantly replies, He shall not sell his honor to purchase mine! But even though Myrtle's brother gets pulled from his horse just before the race, Diana jumps on and rides to victory, thus saving her lover's hefty wager. This film, played purely for fun and excitement, is melodrama at its very best. <SP> Whip <S> ratings.rated_entity film.film <S> A young man who has experienced a trauma finds solace in his relationship with an old, beat-up car.

The plan is to leave Paris and pick up their children at camp that evening, then spend a couple of weeks in the country relaxing. But when H茅l猫ne keeps him waiting, Antoine begins to drink. After several beers and a scotch, the couple hit the road, and immediately run into traffic leaving the city.

When he gets out, he finds that H茅l猫ne has gone, leaving a note on the car saying she's continuing on by train. Antoine races to the train station, but he's too late, so he wanders into a nearby bar. There, he buys a drink for a sullen young man (Vincent Deniard), who later approaches him in the parking lot, asking for a ride.

Amidst the tumult of the French Revolution, one of them makes the supreme sacrifice for love. <SP> A Tale of Two Cities <S> broadcast.content ratings.rated_entity media_common.creative_work media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.adaptation award.nominated_work award.ranked_item film.film <S> It is a tale known well, filmed many times over the years, but never better than this early black and white version from the MGM Studios, David O. Selznick producing. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times-- Charles Dickens juxtaposes England and France, George and Louis, tradition and revolution. One of the most beloved of Dickens' stories, finding not only countries and conditions compared, but also two individuals thrown up in stark contrast to one another: -- the dissolute barrister Sydney Carton (Ronald Colman) and the young, somewhat callow aristocrat Charles Darnay (Donald Woods), both in love with Lucie (Elizabeth Allan), daughter of a victim of the French Regime. Their lives intertwine until the violent revolution that overtook an entire nation engulfs them all as well. Dickens' story has stood the test of time; remade frequently since the release of this1935 version. It is this version by director Jack Conway's that is best remembered and to which all others are compared. The settings, cinematography, and direction are all right on the mark, recreating the streets of London and of Paris with great skill and realism. The supporting cast, filled with faces we have grown to cherish-- Reginald Owen, Edna May Oliver, Claude Gillingwater, Walter Catlett, H. B. Warner, Basil Rathbone, and E. E. Clive-comes through with crystalline performances which add substance to the inexorable stream of events. Blanche Yurka's bravura turn as Therese de Farge delights us even as we shudder at her intensity. Second unit directors Jacques Tourneur and Val Lewton, who would both go on to memorable careers as leading directors in their own right, staged the storming of the Bastille and other revolutionary scenes brilliantly, managing to combine fervor with panache. It is, however, Colman's portrayal of the lonely man redeemed by love and sacrifice which stands at the center of the story. Sydney Carton first saves Charles Darnay from a charge of treason, thereby meeting those who care for him: the beautiful Lucie Manette, her father, Doctor Manette (Henry B. Walthall), released from the Bastille after many years of unjust incarceration; Lucie's servant Miss Pross, (Oliver) and Mister Lorry (Claude Gillingwater), an functionary of Tellson's Bank. His relationship with this circle of kind friends grows rocky when Darnay marries Lucie, whom Carton has loved from afar, but even this turn of events cannot change his feelings for them all and he grows to love them even more when daughter Lucie comes along. He reforms, leaving old ways behind and enjoying a familial warmth he has never known. This happy life is shattered when Darnay returns to France during the first revolutionary struggles, intent on saving his old tutor from the guillotine. He soon finds himself behind bars and facing the blade instead. The Revolution does not forget an aristocrat, even one who has recanted and lived life abroad as a commoner. The whole family makes the channel crossing to come to the young man's aid and Carton seeks a way to save him, discovering only one path to free Darnay and return everyone to safety. It is a sacrifice easily promised and quickly made. Ronald Colman had long wanted to make a film of this story and, when he finally got his chance, he happily shaved off his signature mustache in an appropriate gesture to historical realism. Reviews of his work indicate his portrayal of Sydney Carton surpassed all his previous endeavors; he had been accused of walking through light parts, once he started making talkies, and not putting his many talents to good use. A Tale of Two Cities put rest to those complaints. He dominates completely the scenes he which he does appear, and his skill gives substance to a literary achievement, a melancholy man of intelligence and wit, given to drink and despair, whose life seems to attain meaning only when it is given up for someone else. It is one of the portrayals for which Ronald Colman has come to be remembered. There are various remake versions of A Tale of Two Cities. Dirk Bogarde played Carton in 1958 and Chris Sarandon starred in a television remake in 1980. While these and other versions have all been good films, none has achieved the stature of the 1935 version and its excellent combination of star power, technical brilliance and great storytelling.

Bevan#R##N##R##N##R##N#Henry of Bolingbroke was one of the most important noblemen of the later fourteenth century. Brave, chivalrous and cultured, a talented musician, he excelled at the jousts held at his cousin Richard II's Court, acquiring military experience at Radcot Bridge in Oxfordshire and later fighting with the Teutonic Knights in Prussia. A great medieval traveller, he visited Konigsberg as Earl of Derby, travelling to Danzig, Prague and later Venice and Jerusalem. Bitterly opposed to Richard II's favourites, Bolingbroke as one of the Lords Appellant played a vital part. Henry's most controversial actions were the deposition of Richard II (1399) and the execution of Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York, after he had usurped Richard's throne. As Henry IV, an usurper, the King knew little peace, incessantly engrossed as he was in preserving his throne; and the French and Scots never allowed him to forget his usurpation. For many years he fought a savage and frustrating war against the great Welsh rebel Owain Glyn Dwr, but defeated the immortal Harry Percy (Hotspur) at the Battle of Shrewsbury (1403). In his relations with his Parliaments, Henry showed acumen and praiseworthy restraint, unlike his predecessor who was determined to be an absolute King. His short reign was remarkable for the development of Parliament. <SP> Henry IV <S> award.winning_work book.book book.written_work ratings.rated_entity media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work award.ranked_item <S> Henry IV (1399鈥?413), the son of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, seized the English throne at the age of thirty-two from his cousin Richard II and held it until his death, aged forty-five, when he was succeeded by his son, Henry V. This comprehensive and nuanced biography restores to his rightful place a king often overlooked in favor of his illustrious progeny.#R##N#聽#R##N#Henry faced the usual problems of usurpers: foreign wars, rebellions, and plots, as well as the ambitions and demands of the Lancastrian retainers who had helped him win the throne. By 1406 his rule was broadly established, and although he became ill shortly after this and never fully recovered, he retained ultimate power until his death. Using a wide variety of previously untapped archival materials, Chris Given-Wilson reveals a cultured, extravagant, and skeptical monarch who crushed opposition ruthlessly but never quite succeeded in satisfying the expectations of his own supporters.

Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side with a recklessness that threatens to destroy her. -- (C) Official Site

What are the affected areas for Hurricane Nora <SP> Hurricane Nora <S> meteorology.tropical_cyclone <S> Hurricane Nora was the final of five tropical cyclones to make landfall in the 2003 Pacific hurricane season. The fourteenth named storm and fifth hurricane of the season, Nora developed on October 1 from a tropical wave. It slowly intensified as it moved northwestward, intensifying into a hurricane on October 4. That day, Nora rapidly intensified to its peak of 100 mph (160 km/h), but the larger Hurricane Olaf to its east prevented further strengthening. An approaching trough turned the rapidly weakening system to the east toward Mexico. By October 7, it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Although it no longer met the criteria for being a tropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center continued issuing advisories due to the cyclone's proximity with land. Nora unexpectedly redeveloped an area of thunderstorms and moved ashore near Mazatl谩n, Sinaloa on October 9 before dissipating. The depression dropped locally heavy rainfall in western Mexico, but there were no reports of damage. Later, the remnants combined with Olaf and an upper-level low to produce flooding and a tornado in central Texas. <SP> Hurricane Nora <S> meteorology.tropical_cyclone time.event <S> Hurricane Nora was only the third tropical cyclone on record to reach Arizona as a tropical storm. Nora was the fourteenth named tropical cyclone and seventh hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season. The September storm formed off the Pacific coast of Mexico, and aided by waters warmed by El Ni帽o, eventually peaked at Category 4 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Nora intensified and weakened quickly before taking an unusual path, which led it to make landfall twice as a hurricane in Baja California. After landfall, its remnants affected the Southwestern United States with tropical storm-force winds, torrential rain and flooding. Nora is blamed for two direct casualties in Mexico, as well as substantial beach erosion on the Mexican coast, flash flooding in Baja California, and record precipitation in Arizona. Nora persisted far inland and eventually dissipated near the Arizona鈥揘evada border.

At that meeting at a ball, Tom also meets the seductive Susan Atwell, the two who embark on a relationship which blossoms into love on both sides. It isn't until they fall in love that Susan discloses to Tom that she is Brice's kept mistress. When Brice discovers that Susan is seeing another unknown man (Tom), Brice accidentally kills her in a fit of jealous rage. In an effort to protect Brice against being charged for murder, Pritchard devises a plan that they will pin Susan's murder on a suspected but unsubstantiated Soviet spy, code named Yuri, who would have used her to gain intelligence into US military secrets. Yuri is to be whoever was Susan's lover, who they are unaware of is Tom. When they hand the case to Tom to investigate, they do not tell him that Brice was actually the one who killed her. During the investigation, Tom has to protect himself against anyone who may find out that he was Susan's lover and thus the suspected Yuri while finding out who really did kill Susan, which may be difficult if only because of Pritchard's goal to protect Brice at any and all cost, no matter who gets in the way. <SP> No Way Out <S> film.film broadcast.content award.ranked_item award.nominated_work media_common.cataloged_instance ratings.rated_entity media_common.creative_work <S> A pioneering film about racial tensions, No Way Out stars Richard Widmark as a criminal named Ray Biddle, who despises African-Americans. Sidney Poitier (in his screen debut) is the black doctor, Luther Brooks, assigned to take care of the wounded Ray. Dr. Brooks, hired by the police hospital as part of an overall program to integrate the staff, keeps his temper in check as Ray spouts his racist invective. When Ray's brother, also wounded, dies in the hospital, the blustering bigot holds Dr. Brooks responsible and sends word to his gang to wreak vengeance on the city's black community. But the blacks turn the tables on the whites and fight them off. Ray then breaks out of the hospital with Dr. Brooks as hostage. His plans to kill the doctor are thwarted by Ray's girlfriend (Linda Darnell), who finally becomes fed up with his blind hatred. No Way Out was considered potent stuff in 1950; it was still regarded as a hot potato in 1962, when NBC dropped plans to telecast the film on Saturday Night at the Movies.

What is Tropical Storm Bret affecting area <SP> Tropical Storm Bret <S> meteorology.tropical_cyclone <S> Tropical Storm Bret was the second named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season. Bret formed along the southwestern periphery of a weather front north of the Bahamas on July 17. At first, the storm moved little and gradually strengthened in response to favorable upper-level conditions, reaching peak sustained winds of 70 mph. Steering currents in the area subsequently became better established, and Bret turned toward the northeast only to encounter a substantial increase in vertical wind shear. Despite the shear, the storm maintained a well-defined wind circulation for several days, with intermittent bursts of thunderstorms near its center. By July 22, Bret had been devoid of strong thunderstorm activity for several hours, prompting the National Hurricane Center to discontinue public advisories when it was located about 375 miles north of Bermuda. Since Bret remained over the open Atlantic for most of its existence, its effects on land were limited. While moving little, the storm produced inclement weather and widespread cloudiness over much of the north-central Bahamas. <SP> Tropical Storm Bret <S> time.event meteorology.tropical_cyclone <S> Tropical Storm Bret was the deadliest natural disaster in Venezuela since the 1967 Caracas earthquake. The third tropical cyclone of 1993 Atlantic hurricane season, Bret formed on August 4 from a westward-moving, African tropical wave. Bret would later peak as a 60 mph (95 km/h) tropical storm as it neared Trinidad. It took an extremely southerly course through the Caribbean, passing over the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. High terrain in the northern parts of those countries severely disrupted the circulation of the storm, and Bret had weakened to a tropical depression before emerging over the extreme southwestern Caribbean Sea. There, it restrengthened to a tropical storm and made landfall in Nicaragua on August 10, dissipating soon after. Bret's remnants reached the Pacific Ocean, where they ultimately became Hurricane Greg.

That role of the priest was revoked when the church felt that the vampire problem was no more in having confined them. When teenaged Lucy Pace is abducted, signs being that abduction carried out by vampires, her uncle, a priest (hereafter referred to solely as Priest), is determined to find her before she becomes infected. In doing so, Priest goes against the church, which refuses to reinstate his authority as a vampire battler in not believing that there is a vampire problem and which states that in going against the church is going against God. Joining Priest in searching for Lucy is Hicks, a sheriff outside the church walls, he who is in love with Lucy, and Priestess, one of Priest's old colleagues with who he has a special bond. If they are able to find who abducted Lucy, they will discover that their adversary has past ties to them. In the process, a potential problem arises in deciding what to do if they find that Lucy has already been infected, Hicks who will not allow her to die under any circumstance, while Priest is willing to kill her in she no longer being who she was, killing her despite his closer tie to her than he divulges.

In a tiny village during the Hundred Years' War, teenager Joan d'Arc (Leelee Sobieski) has been raised by her parents, flinty Peter (Powers Boothe) and Isabelle (Jacqueline Bisset), amidst the wreckage continually wrought by British incursions into the area. A devout girl, Joan experiences visions of St. Catherine, which lead her to believe that she may be the Maid of Orleans, a mythical figure who will lead France to victory over its enemies. Counseled by local priest Father Monet (Robert Loggia), Joan pursues her destiny in spite of her father's wishes. At first supported only by lowly commoners, Joan comes to the attention of the Dauphin, King Charles (Neil Patrick Harris). Together with his scheming advisor Bishop Cauchon (Emmy-winner Peter O'Toole), Charles uses Joan to unite his quarreling factions. Skeptical but superstitious, Charles' generals, including La Hire (Peter Strauss) are eventually won over by Joan's startling victories. But awaiting Joan is a disastrous Parisian campaign and Charles' betrayal.

Veeram (Milind Gunaji) and his wife Rambhi (Shabana Azmi) are forced to leave their village and move to a larger city in search of work when a drought devastates the local farmland. At his new job, Veeram murders his foreman, a cruel and bigoted man who openly loathes people of Veeram's caste. It seems that the foreman had many enemies, because the police refuse to investigate the matter and Veeram finds himself rising up the ladder of local politics. But when Veeram renounces the use of violence against the people, he's assassinated, and Rambhi is elected to take his place. While she assumes leadership with good intentions, she soon displays a willingness to use her authority to brutalize others and is not above the use of violence to achieve her ends. Rambhi's increasingly corrupt rule reaches a turning point when her son demands to marry a Muslim, leading to public outcry and rioting in the streets. Godmother, which includes several musical numbers, was shown as part of the World Cinema program at the 1999 Montreal Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

For the most part each issue featured a team of four artists, one of whom would illustrate each of the three stories, the fourth supplying that month's cover. Initially, these duties were meant to rotate among Don Simpson, David Lloyd, Bill Loebs, and George Freeman, but by issue 13 Freeman, Lloyd and Loebs had all left the series. Later issues featured Bill Wray as a regular and such guest artists as Timothy Truman, Joe Orlando and Ty Templeton. For the most part, the series avoided the sort of gory shock associated with the twist ending horror comics typified by Tales from the Crypt and The Twilight Zone television series in favor of more unpredictable and ambivalent stories. The themes of alienation and psychological dread often occurred, mixed with grotesque black humor, absurdism and social and political commentary in the form of satire. <SP> Wasteland <S> comic_books.series book.written_work <S> Wasteland is a monthly comic book series written by Antony Johnston, drawn by Christopher Mitten with covers by Ben Templesmith, and published by Oni Press. Issue #1 debuted in July 2006. The series is set one hundred years after the Big Wet, an unspecified disaster that destroyed modern society and, it is assumed, changed the world's coastlines. The story takes place somewhere in America, now a barren desert and dustbowl without modern technology. The seas are poisonous, and subsistence farming with small amounts of livestock appears to be the norm. The book also has theme music, composed and performed by Johnston, which can be downloaded from the official website.

Located next to the Alberta Legislature Building, the bridge linked the separate communities of Edmonton and Strathcona, which became one city in 1912. It was designed from the outset to accommodate rail, streetcar, automobile and pedestrian traffic. The bridge was designated a Municipal Historic Resource in 1995. Trucks are prohibited on the bridge due to the low clearance of 3.2 metres and substandard lane width, despite the bridge being classified as a 24-hour truck route on city maps. Currently street traffic is one-way southbound. At the north end of the bridge 109 Street becomes the left lane, and 110 Street becomes the right lane. The next bridge downstream, the Walterdale Bridge, is a two-lane bridge with one-way northbound traffic into the downtown. The Canadian Pacific Railway, responsible for the design of the bridge, ceased rail operations over the span in 1989. <SP> High Level Bridge <S> ratings.rated_entity transportation.bridge architecture.structure local.entity location.location projects.project_focus <S> The High Level Bridge is a road and railway bridge spanning the River Tyne between Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead in North East England.

What cities does Buffalo River go through <SP> Buffalo River <S> geography.river geography.geographical_feature geography.body_of_water location.location <S> The Buffalo River drains a 447 square mile watershed, emptying into the eastern end of Lake Erie at the City of Buffalo. The river has three tributaries: Cayuga Creek, Buffalo Creek, and Cazenovia Creek. The Buffalo River has been important to the development of western New York, including as the terminus for the Erie Canal beginning in 1825, and later as an industrial area with uses including grain elevators, steel mills and chemical production. When shipping began to bypass the Erie Canal in the 1950s, and later with the decline of heavy industry in the region, the transportation and industrial use of the river greatly declined and many adjacent factories and grain mills were abandoned. The river and adjacent sites have been the focus of efforts over several decades to improve water quality and restore habitat, most recently in 2011 with the commencement of the Buffalo River Restoration Project. <SP> Buffalo River <S> geography.body_of_water geography.geographical_feature location.location geography.river travel.destination <S> The Buffalo River, located in northern Arkansas, was the first National River to be designated in the United States. The Buffalo River is slightly more than 150 miles long. The lower 135 miles flow within the boundaries of an area managed by the National Park Service, where the stream is designated the Buffalo National River. The river flows through Newton, Searcy, Marion, and Baxter Counties, from west to east. The river originates in the highest part of Boston Mountains of the Ozarks, flows out onto the Springfield Plateau near the historic community of Erbie, and finally crosses the Salem Plateau just before joining the White River. The Park is home to the state's only elk herd. The upper section of the river in the Ozark National Forest is managed by the U.S. Forest Service and is designated as a National Scenic River and a National Wild River; that section is not part of the area managed as a park by the Park Service, but is managed as a part of the Ozark National Forest. The Buffalo National River was established by an Act of Congress on March 1, 1972, ending the recurring plans of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct one or more dams on the river.

It first appeared on their breakthrough album, Surrealistic Pillow, with a live version later appearing on the expanded rerelease of Bless Its Pointed Little Head. Marty Balin said, I wrote it to try to meet Tony Bennett. He was recording in the next studio. I admired him, so I thought I'd write him a song. I never got to meet him, but the Airplane ended up doing it. Jerry Garcia plays the simple, repetitive but poignant lead guitar riff on the song. <SP> Today <S> ratings.rated_entity cvg.musical_game_song media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work music.composition <S> Today is a song by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins, written by lead vocalist and guitarist Billy Corgan. The song, though seemingly upbeat, contains dark lyrics. Corgan wrote the song about a day in which he was having suicidal thoughts, exemplified by the reference to self-mutilation in the chorus. The contrast between the grim subject matter of the song and the soft instrumental part during the verses, coupled with use of irony in the lyrics, left many listeners unaware of the song's tale of depression and desperation. The song alternates between quiet, dreamy verses and loud choruses with layered, distorted guitar similar to the noisy guitar rock of My Bloody Valentine. Today was released in September 1993 as the second single from the band's second album and major label debut, Siamese Dream. Although Corgan opted for Cherub Rock, the lead single from the album, to be the opening track, Today and its follow-up Disarm are credited in AllMusic for popularizing the band and sen[ding] [Siamese Dream] into the stratosphere.

Born in Dallas, Texas, Stevie Ray Vaughan had a rough home life, and spent most of his time focused on his guitar as a means of escape. He formed his first band in 1965, at age 10, and spent the majority of the rest of his school years barely able to stay awake in class, since he was playing in clubs every night. After years of toil, Mr. Vaughan finally achieved a modicum of success playing with his trio named, Double Trouble. He also worked on David Bowie's smash hit album, Let's Dance, but declined to join Bowie's band full time. Double Trouble enjoyed massive success throughout the 80s, but had to take a break in the late 80s, when Stevie Ray Vaughan's substance abuse issues almost killed him.

On August 27, 1990, he was killed in a helicopter crash while traveling back to Chicago from a concert in Wisconsin.

It was first performed on 7 April 1824 in St. Petersburg, Russia, under the auspices of Beethoven's patron Prince Nikolai Galitzin; an incomplete performance was given in Vienna on 7 May 1824, when the Kyrie, Credo, and Agnus Dei were conducted by the composer. It is generally considered one of the composer's supreme achievements and, along with Bach's Mass in B minor, one of the most significant Mass settings of the common practice period. Despite critical recognition as one of Beethoven's great works from the height of his composing career, Missa solemnis has not achieved the same level of popular attention that many of his symphonies and sonatas have enjoyed. Written around the same time as his Ninth Symphony, it is Beethoven's second setting of the Mass, after his Mass in C, Op. 86. The Mass is scored for 2 flutes; 2 oboes, 2 clarinets; 2 bassoons; contrabassoon; 4 horns; 2 trumpets; alto, tenor, and bass trombone; timpani; organ continuo; strings; soprano, alto, tenor, and bass soloists; and mixed choir.

For a small area, Squak Mountain has many trails. Like many of the intermediate trails described in this book, Squak is a good workout for an advanced runner looking for a short but brisk run. Squak Mountain got its name from the Native American term for the fertile valley, creek, and mountain that now form the town of Issaquah. Geologically, Squak Mountain is the middle or 鈥渓ittle sister鈥?in the Cougar, Squak, and Tiger Mountain threesome, commonly known as the Issaquah Alps. Like the others, over the years Squak has been logged and was the site of a wooden tie mill and a coal mine. Starting in the 1940s, Seattle attorney Stinson Bullitt began acquiring the land and stopped any further commercial exploits. In 1972 his family (founders of KING radio and television) donated the land to the state with the stipulation that it would never be logged.

Who is art director of World War III <SP> World War III <S> award.nominated_work award.winning_work broadcast.content film.film media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work ratings.rated_entity tv.program <S> World War III is an ambitious if unnecessarily protracted speculative TV movie. Set in a future December, the film prophesies an American grain embargo levied on Russia. US President Rock Hudson is entreated by the Soviet higher-ups to drop the ban; meanwhile, a group of renegade Russian military officers begin sending expeditionary forces into Alaska. While the countdown to Doomsday begins, the film insists upon cutting back to several expendable romances in both the American and Soviet camps. Boris Sagal, the original director of World War III, was killed in a freak helicopter accident while on location. To make up for lost time, the production was moved to the soundstages of Zoetrope Studios and overseen by ultra-efficient TV director David Greene. Part Two finds novice American president Rock Hudson trying to effect an honorable peace with Soviet premiere Brian Keith. But insurgent military officers endeavoring to seize the Alaska Pipeline as a bargaining chip continue to escalate the hostilities. It develops that the fate of the world may rest in the hands of American colonel David Soul. Also appearing is Cathy Lee Crosby, endearingly miscast as an intelligence officer. A heart-stopping surprise twist brings World War III to a close. While the film has its moments of genuine suspense, one can't help but feel that World War III would have been better an hour or two shorter--or at least with a few of the subplot romances removed.

The volcano is the fourth tallest peak in Washington state, and not as much is known about it compared to other volcanoes in the area. Local Native Americans have recognized Glacier Peak and other Washington volcanoes in their histories and stories. When foreign explorers reached the region, they learned basic information about surrounding landforms, but did not initially understand that Glacier Peak was a volcano. Positioned in Snohomish County, the volcano is only 70 miles northeast of Seattle. The only volcano closer to Seattle is Mount Rainier, but as Glacier Peak is set farther into the Cascades and almost 4,000 feet shorter, it is less noticeable than Mount Rainier.

Mountain ranges for Camelback Mountain? <SP> Camelback Mountain <S> geography.geographical_feature geography.mountain location.location travel.destination <S> Camelback Mountain or Big Pocono is a conspicuous geographic feature on the Pocono Plateau. It is not a mountain, but rather a peninsular section of the Pocono Plateau, that when viewed from three sides, appears to be a mountain. The summit of Big Pocono Mountain is actually nearly level with land to the west and northwest, together comprising the top of the Glaciated Pocono Plateau, which is part of the larger Allegheny Plateau. The Pocono Plateau, a distinctive geologic feature not to be confused with the larger Pocono Mountains, is a glaciated plateau formed during at least three glacial movements. As glaciers moved south from Canada, they scraped flat what is now the plateau. The Glacier Movements also created other distinctive features of this region, including peat bogs and swamps, which resulted when glacial scour produced un-drained scars on the plateau's surface. Examples of depressions created by glacial scour include Deep Lake and Wolf Swamp just west of Big Pocono State Park. Big Pocono's distinctive shape, hence its nickname, and 1,000 ft prominence above land to the south, east, and north makes it plainly visible from the east and south. <SP> Camelback Mountain <S> local.restaurant location.landmark_building location.location location.park media_common.subject ratings.rated_entity travel.tourist_attraction geography.geographical_feature geography.mountain local.entity <S> Camelback Mountain (O'odham: Cew S-wegiom) is a mountain in Phoenix, Arizona, United States.

It held both records for 34 years until the completion of Burj Khalifa and Canton Tower in 2010. It remains the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, a signature icon of Toronto's skyline, and a symbol of Canada, attracting more than two million international visitors annually. Its name CN originally referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets, prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for real estate development. Since the name CN Tower became common in daily usage, the abbreviation was eventually expanded to Canadian National Tower or Canada's National Tower. However, neither of these names is commonly used.

State the name of the album prior to Heartstrings <SP> Heartstrings <S> music.album commerce.product <S> Heartstrings was the sixth and final solo album released by Canadian singer-songwriter Willie P. Bennett and was released on CD by Bennett's own Bnatural Records in 1998 (Bnatural 0998). The album was something of a departure for Bennett from his earlier solo work. Reflecting his many years spent playing mandolin in Fred Eaglesmith's band, the songs were mostly written and performed by Bennett on mandolin and harmonica, instead of guitar. The musical territory covered on this album is broader than earlier works. In addition to folk, country, bluegrass and blues, Bennett also incorporates elements of klezmer, gospel and classical. <SP> Heartstrings <S> commerce.consumer_product commerce.product media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work music.album ratings.rated_entity <S> Heartstrings is the fourth studio album of London-based Australian indie rock band Howling Bells. The album was released through Birthday Records on 2 June 2014 to generally favourable reviews. It was co-produced by Catherine J. Marks and Alan Moulder, and recorded at Assault & Battery 2, London, in November 2013. Howling Bells, by and large, did not write for Heartstrings until more than two years following the release of their previous album, The Loudest Engine. Over that period, the band members committed themselves to other ventures. Original Howling Bells bass guitarist Brendan Picchio, left the band and was eventually replaced with Gary Daines. Furthermore, vocalist and rhythm guitarist Juanita Stein became a first-time mother after giving birth. The writing and recording process for Heartstrings was quick and was completed within the span of one month. The album bears resemblance to Howling Bells' first album Howling Bells, musically, thematically, and in the cinematic sense. The band moved on from record label Cooking Vinyl and entered an agreement with Birthday Records. Heartstrings and its accompanying singles failed to place on music charts in any nation.

Santi is a 16-year-old boy who lives in Barcelona with his mother, Julia. But while most folks who live in Barcelona love to bask in the golden rays of the sun, Santi has a rare genetic disease that causes him to suffer severe sunburn and eye irritation within minutes of exposure to ultraviolet light. Ideally, Santi would like to move to the shadowed town of Laponia in northern Sweden, but funds are tight and his mother cannot afford to make such a move. After a heartfelt discussion between mother and son, Julia agrees to move to Arrozas de Valdeon -- a remote village shaded by the high mountains on all sides. But strange things are happening in Arrozas de Valdeon; animals are disappearing, and rumors are circulating that something in the woods is responsible. One day, Santi witnesses the killing of a young boy. No one else was around at the time the murder occurred, making Santi the prime suspect in the eyes of the villagers. In order to avoid any further problems, local policeman Antonio asks Julia to keep an especially tight leash on Santi as an investigation gets under way. But Santi is determined to prove his innocence, and after making friends with a local girl named Angela, the pair sets out to locate the mysterious creature rumored to stalk the local woods. What Santi and Angela discover over the course of their investigation can only be described as tragic. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi

Upon receiving word that the Antarctic research team has unearthed an alien craft, paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) joins the group to explore what secrets the ship might hold. Though by Kate's estimation the creature inside the spaceship has been dead for centuries, it has actually just been lying dormant in the ice. Perfectly preserved, it has awaited the day when it would finally be freed from its frigid prison; now, after eons of lying in wait, that day has finally come. Suddenly revived during a crucial experiment, the malevolent alien begins methodically mimicking each member of the crew undetected. By the time Kate realizes the frightening implications of the creature's unique ability, it may already be too late. As paranoia among the crew begins to intensify, it's up to Kate and the crew's helicopter pilot, Carter (Joel Edgerton), to make sure the extraterrestrial menace is exterminated before it has the opportunity to escape -- for, should it manage to make its way to a heavily populated area, humanity's days may be numbered.

His third feature film Women in Love (1969) was a triumph and he became an internationally known filmmaker. In the 1970s, his talent truly blossomed. Over the next 2 decades, he would direct a succession of remarkable films, most of them contained his trademark flamboyance that critics generally dismiss but many seem to find this engrossing. He will forever be remembered as a controversial and visionary artist with something of a third eye when it comes to making oddball dramas that have captivating images and themes.

The upper Green River valley forms the western approach to Stampede Pass, and was once home to many small railroad and logging towns such as Weston, Lester, Green River Hot Springs, Nagrom, Maywood, Humphreys, Eagle Gorge, Lemolo, and Kanaskat. Shortly before World War I, the City of Tacoma, Washington, filed for water rights on the Green River. Today, much of the upper valley has become a gated water supply watershed for Tacoma and access is heavily restricted, creating controversy among recreation enthusiasts. <SP> Green River <S> geography.river geography.body_of_water geography.geographical_feature location.location travel.destination <S> The Green River, located in the western United States, is the chief tributary of the Colorado River. The watershed of the river, known as the Green River Basin, covers parts of Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado. The Green River is 730 miles long, beginning in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming and flowing through Wyoming and Utah for most of its course, except for 40 miles into western Colorado. Much of the route is through the Colorado Plateau and through some of the most spectacular canyons in the United States. It is only slightly smaller than the Colorado when the two rivers merge, but typically carries a larger load of silt. The average yearly mean flow of the river at Green River, Utah is 6,121 cubic feet per second. The status of the Green River as a tributary of the Colorado River came about for mainly political reasons. In earlier nomenclature, the Colorado River began at its confluence with the Green River. Above the confluence the Colorado was called the Grand River. In 1921, Colorado U.S. Representative Edward T. Taylor petitioned the Congressional Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce to rename the Grand River as the Colorado River.

What is the class of Isoniazid <SP> Isoniazid <S> chemistry.chemical_compound chemistry.chemical_substance medicine.condition_prevention_factors medicine.drug medicine.drug_formulation_ingredient medicine.medical_procedure medicine.medical_treatment <S> Isoniazid, also known as isonicotinylhydrazine, is an organic compound that is the first-line medication in prevention and treatment of tuberculosis. The compound was first synthesized in the early 20th century, but its activity against tuberculosis was first reported in the early 1950s, and three pharmaceutical companies attempted unsuccessfully to patent the drug simultaneously, the most prominent one being Roche, which launched its version, Rimifon, in 1952. The drug was first tested at Many Farms, a Navajo community, due to the Navajo reservation's dire tuberculosis problem and because the population had not previously been treated with streptomycin, the main tuberculosis treatment at the time. With the introduction of isoniazid, a cure for tuberculosis was first considered to be possible. Isoniazid is available in tablet, syrup, and injectable forms. It is available worldwide, is inexpensive, and is generally well tolerated. It is manufactured from isonicotinic acid, which is produced from 4-methylpyridine. The abbreviation INH is common for referring to isoniazid, but abbreviating drug names is not best practice in medicine. <SP> Isoniazid <S> medicine.drug <S> Isoniazid is an antibiotic that fights bacteria. Isoniazid is used to treat and to prevent tuberculosis (TB). You may need to take other TB medicines in combination with isoniazid. When treating active TB, isoniazid must be used with other TB medicines. Tuberculosis can become resistant to treatment if isoniazid is used alone. Take all your medicines as prescribed by your doctor. Isoniazid may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.

Co-written by Gilles Marchand (Who Killed Bambi?) and Kahn's frequent writing partner Laurence Ferreira Barbosa, Red Lights is based on a novel by Georges Simenon. In the film, Antoine (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) seems to be looking forward to taking his wife, H茅l猫ne (Carole Bouquet), for a long drive. The plan is to leave Paris and pick up their children at camp that evening, then spend a couple of weeks in the country relaxing. But when H茅l猫ne keeps him waiting, Antoine begins to drink. After several beers and a scotch, the couple hit the road, and immediately run into traffic leaving the city. Antoine has been hearing stories of horrible accidents on the road all evening, but that doesn't stop him from driving like a madman. When H茅l猫ne complains about his erratic driving, things just get worse. When they're not bickering, they're glaring silently out at the dark road. Eventually, Antoine decides to pull over for another drink, and when H茅l猫ne threatens to take the car and continue on without him, he takes the keys with him into the bar. When he gets out, he finds that H茅l猫ne has gone, leaving a note on the car saying she's continuing on by train. Antoine races to the train station, but he's too late, so he wanders into a nearby bar. There, he buys a drink for a sullen young man (Vincent Deniard), who later approaches him in the parking lot, asking for a ride. The two soon come to a police roadblock, and Antoine begins to suspect that his traveling companion is the escaped fugitive for whom the cops are looking.

It is a hydrological apex of the North American continent, where the Great and Laurentian divides meet at the summit of the peak. Thus, all water that falls at this point can flow to the Pacific, Atlantic, or Arctic oceans, making the locale one of the few places on the Earth whose waters feed three oceans. Rainfall on the western side of the peak enters Pacific Creek, which in turn enters Nyack Creek, the Middle Fork of the Flathead River, Clark Fork River, Pend Oreille River, and the Columbia River which empties into the Pacific Ocean at Astoria, Oregon. Flathead Lake and Lake Pend Oreille are also fed by this system of rivers, as well as some man-made lakes on the Columbia River. The northeastern slope of the mountain sheds water into Hudson Bay Creek, which then drains into Medicine Owl Creek and Red Eagle Creek. It then empties into Saint Mary Lake, which feeds the St. Mary River, which in turn flows into the Oldman River, Saskatchewan River, and the Nelson River, which empties into Hudson Bay. <SP> Triple Divide Peak <S> location.location geography.mountain geography.geographical_feature <S> Triple Divide Peak is a mountain along the Great Western Divide in the Sierra Nevada range on the border between Kings Canyon National Park and Sequoia National Park, in Tulare County, California.

What is Hurricane Danielle affecting area <SP> Hurricane Danielle <S> time.event meteorology.tropical_cyclone <S> Hurricane Danielle resulted in minor damage throughout its duration as a tropical cyclone in late August and early September 1998. The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Danielle originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on August 21. Tracking generally west-northwestward, the disturbance was initially disorganized; under favorable atmospheric conditions, shower and thunderstorm activity began to consolidate around a low-pressure center. Following a series of satellite intensity estimates, the system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Four during the pre-dawn hours of August 24, and further to Tropical Storm Danielle that afternoon. Moving around the southern periphery of the Azores High located in the northeastern Atlantic, quick intensification to hurricane status occurred early on August 25. By 0600 UTC the following day, Danielle reached an initial peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h), a Category 2 hurricane. Increased wind shear from a nearby trough encroached on further development later that day, and subsequently led to slight weakening. By 1200 UTC on August 27, despite continued unfavorable conditions, Danielle reached a second peak intensity equal to the first. Weakening once ensued late on August 27 in addition to the days following, and Danielle was a low-end Category 1 hurricane by August 31 as its forward speed slowed. <SP> Hurricane Danielle <S> meteorology.tropical_cyclone <S> Hurricane Danielle was the first of several Cape Verde-type hurricane to form during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season.

Danielle never approached land, although it briefly threatened the Azores as it made the northerly turn. As a result, there was no impact caused by the storm.

What is genre of The Passion <SP> The Passion <S> broadcast.content media_common.cataloged_instance tv.program ratings.rated_entity media_common.creative_work <S> The Passion is a television drama serial produced by the BBC and HBO Films in association with Deep Indigo Productions. It tells the story of the last week in the life of Jesus. The serial was first proposed by Peter Fincham in 2006, on the success of the contemporary-set Manchester Passion. Writer Frank Deasy and producer Nigel Stafford-Clark were inspired to make a drama that opened up the story beyond the vacuum it is often told in. They did this by expanding the roles of Pontius Pilate and Caiaphas, and exploring the politics of Judea at the time. Deasy and Stafford-Clark were aided by scholar Mark Goodacre, with whom they put together an extensive research manual about the topic. The part of Jesus is played by Joseph Mawle, who researched the role by reading the Gospels and research papers. Other main roles were played by Paloma Baeza, Ben Daniels, James Nesbitt, David Oyelowo, and Penelope Wilton. It was directed by Michael Offer on location in Morocco from 27 August to 23 October 2007, and broadcast on BBC One in four parts from 16 to 23 March 2008.

The novel was influenced by the American crime writer James M. Cain and the stories in the pulp magazine Black Mask. No Orchids for Miss Blandish provoked considerable controversy because of its explicit depiction of sexuality and violence. The novel was a great critical success and was included in the Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century. In 1942, the novel was adapted into a stage play which ran for over 200 performances at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London. In 1948, it was adapted into a British film No Orchids for Miss Blandish. The 1971 American film The Grissom Gang was also based on the novel. It was also the subject of a fairly well-known essay by George Orwell, Raffles and Miss Blandish, and parodied by Raymond Queneau in We Always Treat Women Too Well. The 1939 novel was extensively rewritten and rearranged by the author in 1962 because he thought the world of 1939 too distant for a new generation of readers. Unfortunately this means that readers of the Orwell essay will not understand many of Orwell's quotations and references because they came from the earlier edition.

Signing with Cobb's Greengrass Productions, Gloria recorded her first hit record, Heartbeat Pts 1 & 2, which Cobb wrote and produced. Heartbeat became a classic rhythm and blues tune which later was recorded by Dusty Springfield, Spencer Davis and many other artists who attempted to capture that phenomenal Gloria Jones sound.

So strong was Gloria's following there that she was proclaimed the Northern Queen of Soul. Marc Bolan of T-Rex was so impressed by Gloria's talents that they joined forces.

This title suggests that an analysis of one of the globe's ancient forms of communication might teach us about how to avoid seemingly anxieties about globalisation and the flattening of the world. <SP> A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World <S> media_common.creative_work media_common.cataloged_instance book.written_work book.book award.winning_work award.ranked_item ratings.rated_entity <S> Adam Smith wrote that man has an intrinsic 聯propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.鈥?But how did trade evolve to the point where we don鈥檛 think twice about biting into an apple from the other side of the world? In this sweeping narrative history of world trade, William J. Bernstein tells the extraordinary story of global commerce from its prehistoric origins to the myriad controversies surrounding it today. He transports readers from ancient sailing ships that brought the silk trade from China to Rome in the second century to the rise and fall of the Portuguese monopoly in spices in the sixteenth; from the American trade battles of the early twentieth century to the modern era of televisions from Taiwan, lettuce from Mexico, and T-shirts from China. Lively, authoritative, and astonishing in scope, A Splendid Exchange is a riveting narrative that views trade and globalization not in political terms, but rather as an evolutionary process as old as war and religion--a historical constant--that will continue to foster the growth of intellectual capital, shrink the world, and propel the trajectory of the human species.

The album features two drummers, Dirk Verbeuren and Ryan Van Poederooyen, as well as a number of guest vocalists. According to an interview with Townsend, the album is a concept album focused around a man who is obsessed with finding the true nature of reality. In the process of this journey, he goes to Hell and meets the devil. The devil shows him the secrets of the universe, presenting a cheeseburger to him. However, being a vegetarian, the man cannot eat the cheeseburger, rendering his attempts at working out the true nature of reality pointless. The album is chaotic in nature and has elements which are prominently humorous, which is a radical departure from Townsend's more recent work. Townsend also stated in this interview that Deconstruction is a musical representation of facing your fears and overcoming them.

The state's name derives from the name of the Congo River, called Zaire in Portuguese, adapted from the Kongo word nzere or nzadi. The state was a right-wing single-party state and dictatorship, run by Mobutu Sese Seko and his ruling Popular Movement of the Revolution party. It was established following Mobutu's seizure of power in a military coup in 1965, following five-years of political upheaval following independence known as the Congo Crisis. Zaire had a strongly centralist constitution and foreign assets were nationalized. A wider campaign of Authenticit茅, ridding the country of the influences from the colonial period, was also launched under Mobutu's direction. Weakened by the end of American support after the end of the Cold War, Mobutu was forced to declare a new republic in 1990 to cope with demands for change. By the time of its disestablishment, Mobutu's rule was characterized by widespread cronyism, corruption and economic mismanagement.

Eve will destroy harmful misconceptions about ourselves. From the author of the 25-million copy bestseller The Shack comes a captivating new novel destined to be one of the most important and talked-about books of the decade. When a shipping container washes ashore on an island between our world and the next, John the Collector finds a young woman inside--broken, frozen, and barely alive. With the aid of Healers and Scholars, John oversees her recovery and soon discovers her genetic code connects her to every known human race. She is a girl of prophecy and no one can guess what her survival will mean... No one but Eve, Mother of the Living, who calls her daughter, and invites her to witness the truth about her story--indeed, the truth about us all. Eve is a bold, unprecedented exploration of the Creation narrative, true to the original texts and centuries of scholarship--yet with breathtaking discoveries that challenge traditional misconceptions about who we are and how we're made. As The Shack awakened readers to a personal, non-religious understanding of God, Eve will free us from faulty interpretations that have corrupted human relationships since the Garden of Eden. Eve opens a refreshing conversation about the equality of men and women within the context of our beginnings, helping us see each other as our Creator does--complete, unique, and not constrained to cultural rules or limitations. Thoroughly researched and exquisitely written, Eve is a masterpiece that will inspire readers for generations to come.

Since its inception almost 40 years ago, less than 200 candidates have reached the exalted Master level. The exam covers literally every nuance of the world of wine, spirits and cigars.

What is adaptation of State Fair? <SP> State Fair <S> book.book book.written_work media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work ratings.rated_entity media_common.adapted_work award.ranked_item <S> First published in the spring of 1932, Phil Stong's whimsical and wise State Fair was an immediate success. Hollywood released a film that fall starring Will Rogers as Abel Frake and a champion hog from an Iowa farm as the famous Blue Boy, the finest Hampshire stud boar in the world. In 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical motion picture launched such memorable songs as It Might as Well Be Spring. In 1962 a movie musical with Pat Boone and Ann-Margret was set at the Texas State Fair. And in 1995 a highly entertaining adaptation of the 1945 musical premiered at the Iowa State Fair before moving on to Broadway. This paperback edition of State Fair, with a new foreword by Robert McCown, reprints the original novel in all its exuberance and freshness. On the surface State Fair simply recounts the adventures of the close-knit Frake family at the Iowa State Fair in the late 1920s, but Stong's universal morality tale has much to reveal to anyone willing to read between the lines. The book shocked some readers in 1932, but most were captivated by the Frakes' good-natured integrity and applauded their spirit. Readers today will find the same joy, liveliness, and insight in this new edition of State Fair. <SP> State Fair <S> award.ranked_item broadcast.content film.film media_common.adaptation media_common.adapted_work media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work ratings.rated_entity award.nominated_work <S> The Frakes - father Abel Frake, mother Melissa Frake, and young adult children Wayne Frake and Margy Frake - are an Iowa farm family getting ready to go to the week-long Iowa State Fair taking place just over one hundred miles away. Wayne isn't looking forward to going as his girlfriend Eleanor won't being going as the two of them have just had an argument, and he is still stinging from being cheated at last year's fair by the ring toss booth operator. Margy, on the other hand, is secretly looking forward to getting away from Harry Ware to whom she is unofficially engaged, as boorish Harry has mapped out their entire lives without even asking her what she really wants. Melissa is confident about the pickles she will be entering for competition, but has to decide to go with or against her temperance mentality in adding brandy to her mincemeat, which she and Abel know deep in their hearts would make it taste better. And Abel may have some problems with his potentially prize winning boar, Blueboy, who seems lethargic for an unknown reason. At the fair, Melissa will learn if she - and behind the scenes Abel - made the right decision about the mincemeat. The cure to Blueboy's woes can be found at the fair, if Abel can just get Blueboy in the right position for that cure to work. And Wayne and Margy leave their romantic issues at home behind them as they fall for fair performer Emily Joyce and newspaper reporter Pat Gilbert respectively, Pat who is covering the fair for his paper, the Register. Can both the Frake offsprings' romances extend beyond the length of the fair, especially considering Emily and Pat's worldly versus Wayne and Margy's cloistered farm life differences?
What is the next album after Swim? <SP> Swim <S> media_common.creative_work music.album ratings.rated_entity commerce.consumer_product media_common.cataloged_instance award.nominated_work award.winning_work commerce.product <S> Swim is an album by Caribou, released in April 2010. It was his first album featuring new material since the 2008 Polaris Music Prize-winning Andorra. It featured great changes in comparison to its predecessor, deviating from the psychedelic pop sound and taking more influences from various kinds of electronic dance music, especially deep house and minimal techno. Dan Snaith, the creative force behind Caribou, said that playing more DJ gigs, such as those at London's Plastic People, influenced him to embrace dance music and a greater range of frequencies in his music. It was songs written for these DJ sets which ultimately came to comprise Swim, though Snaith never originally intended for them to find their way into a Caribou album. Snaith says his work ethic on this album led to about 700 leftover songs, some unfinished, which did not make the album; Swim was, according to Snaith pretty much me getting up every day and wanting to work on music. Working constantly on it. Making loads and loads and loads of music and then just sifting through to find the bits that I like.

The Han River and its surrounding area have played an important role in Korean history. The Three Kingdoms of Korea strove to take control of this land, where the river was used as a trade route to China. However, the river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, barred for entrance by any civilian. Currently, the lower stretches of the Han river are lined with pedestrian walkways, bicycle paths, public parks and restaurants, particularly in Seoul. In a 2011 survey conducted by Seoul Development Institute of 800 residents and 103 urban planning and architectural experts, 51.3 percent of residents and 68.9 percent of experts voted the river the second most scenic location in the city, following Mount Namsan in the top spot.

Anne and Mary Boleyn are under pressure from their father and uncle to help maintain the family's rich legacy and ensure their further prosperity by winning the affections of none other than the king of England (Eric Bana). But life in the royal court is far different than it was in the countryside where these two sisters were raised, and before long their bid to earn the love of the king has transformed two once-happy sisters into bitter rivals. At first, it appears that Mary has triumphed in winning the king's favor by becoming his mistress and bearing him an illegitimate child. Despite her early success, however, Mary has underestimated just how clever and cunning her sibling can truly be. Not only does the relentless Anne manage to edge aside her sister in the eyes of King Henry, but she also succeeds in averting his gaze from his wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon, as well. Mary is driven by genuine affection for King Henry, while her sister Anne has only kept up the charade in a desperate bid to become the queen of England. Now, the growing chasm between two sisters is mirrored on a larger scale as England becomes divided more than ever before. As the consequences of their actions threaten to alter the course of an entire nation, these two sisters will ultimately discover that the only place they will find true strength and loyalty is in family, and that no matter what the consequences they will forever be bound by blood. <SP> The Other Boleyn Girl <S> tv.program ratings.rated_entity media_common.creative_work media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.adaptation film.film broadcast.content <S> The Other Boleyn Girl is a 2003 BBC television film, adapted from Philippa Gregory's novel of the same name.

Unfortunately, this attempt was less successful and Paper Dolls was cancelled after three months. The show was based on a 1982 TV movie, which centered around the modeling business and the corruption of two beautiful and innocent teenage models Taryn and Laurie. However, in the transition to a weekly series, the focus was split between the modeling business and the Harper family whose wealthy conglomerate had a small stake in the modeling business. As a result, the show was diluted with too many characters and convoluting plotlines for viewers to get invested. The original two-hour episode aired opposite the 1984 Prime Time Emmy Awards and scored decent ratings, however, subsequent episodes failed to live up to the ratings potential and the show quietly went off the air before聽resolving any plotlines. Interestingly enough, the two actresses who played the teen models in the series, Terry Farrell and Nicollette Sheridan, later appeared in more successful series.

A graduate of Princeton University, he started in the business, moving props as part of the 20th Century Fox swing gang. Displaying a keen interest in the art of editing, he was taken under the wing of the experienced Robert L. Simpson, whom he accompanied to Paramount as assistant in 1935. After just two years, Reynolds was promoted to full editor, his most prestigious assignment being Algiers (1938). In 1942, he moved across to 20th Century Fox, but wartime service put a temporary halt to his career. However, he did manage to sustain continuity by editing U.S. Army training films. From 1946, Reynolds was part of a top-notch editing team assembled by Darryl F. Zanuck, himself a former editor and famous for his hands-on approach to post-production. During the remainder of his tenure at Fox, Reynolds cut some of the studio's best films, including the excellent sci-fi classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951); and glossy romances and musicals like Three Coins in the Fountain (1954) and Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (1955). Reynolds was a frequent collaborator and preferred editor for directors like Robert Wise and Joshua Logan. He did some of his most acclaimed work after free-lancing for three years, back at Fox, on The Sound of Music (1965) -- winning an Oscar and caustically commenting, when in doubt, cut to Julie Andrews (NY Times, July 22 1997)). Free-lancing again from 1970, he edited the first half of The Godfather (1972) (Francis Ford Coppola assigned the second half to Peter Zinner) and The Sting (1973) (which Reynolds regarded as one of his most demanding assignments). However, towards the end of his career, he was also involved in several significant commercial failures: Heaven's Gate (1980) -- on which he also acted as executive producer, Pirates (1986) and Ishtar (1987). In 1977, Reynolds was named by his peers in a Film Comment poll as one of the three best-ever film editors. <SP> William Reynolds <S> award.nominee award.competitor event.agent award.winner ratings.rated_entity people.person people.deceased_person military.person media_common.cataloged_instance <S> William Reynolds VC was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Avalanche Lake sits at 2885 feet (879 m) between 4,714-foot (1,437 m) Mount Colden and-3816 foot (1163 m) Avalanche Mountain. The two mountains rise in vertical cliffs from the surface of the lake. Immediately west of Avalanche Mountain (formerly known as Caribou Mountain) lies the MacIntyre Range鈥?5,115-foot (1,559 m) Algonquin Peak (the second highest mountain in the state), 4829-foot (1472 m) Boundary Peak, 4,843-foot (1,476 m) Iroquois Peak and 4,380-foot (1,335 m) Mount Marshall.

To the north, the trail to the lake from the Adirondak Loj surmounts Avalanche Pass, which is only slightly above lake level but separates it from the Lake Champlain (St. Lawrence River) watershed. Following the lake toward Lake Colden, the trail is choked with large boulders, and a number of wooden ladders have been built to make passage possible. There are also three places where the trail takes to wooden catwalks, first built in the 1920s, that are bolted directly into the cliff face. This section is known as the Hitch-Up Matilda; in 1868 when a mountain guide waded to carry one of his clients past a point with no footing on shore, her husband urged her to sit higher on his shoulders.

A stint as a singing bartender attracted the attention of Hollywood columnist Jimmy Fidler, who helped him get his show-biz start. Wallace enrolled in drama school in the late 1940s, while earning his living tending the greens at MGM. He soon began landing jobs in films and TV, most notably as Commando Cody in the Republic serial Radar Men from the Moon (1952). He later made his Broadway debut in Richard Rodgers' Pipe Dreams, replaced John Raitt in The Pajama Game and was nominated for a Tony for his leading role in New Girl in Town with Gwen Verdon. Other stage roles have included The Unsinkable Molly Brown opposite Ginger Rogers, Jennie with Mary Martin, Most Happy Fella (during production, he met his present wife, actress Jane A. Johnston), Camelot (as King Arthur), Man of La Mancha, Company, and more. In 1960, his career was stalled when a horse fell on him and broke his back during the making of an episode of TV's Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color (1954)'s Swamp Fox. His painful recovery took seven months. He sometimes billed himself George D. H. Wallace, to avoid confusion with comic George Wallace.

Nirvana intended for the record to diverge significantly from the polished, refined production of its previous album, Nevermind (1991). To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, the group hired engineer Steve Albini to record In Utero during a two-week period in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The music was quickly recorded within that time with few studio embellishments. The song lyrics and album packaging largely incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman Kurt Cobain's outlook on his publicized personal life and his band's newfound fame. <SP> In Utero, in Tribute, in Entirety <S> media_common.cataloged_instance commerce.consumer_product commerce.product media_common.creative_work ratings.rated_entity music.album <S> In Utero, in Tribute, in Entirety is a tribute album to Nirvana's 1993 third and final album, In Utero, by various artists.

Which is park of Wildcat <SP> Wildcat <S> location.location architecture.structure amusement_parks.roller_coaster amusement_parks.ride <S> Wildcat is a wooden roller coaster located at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania. It is located in the Midway America section of the park, just across from Wild Mouse. The ride was named after Wild Cat (Hersheypark), Hersheypark's first roller coaster, which operated from 1923 to 1945. Wildcat was also the first coaster built by Great Coasters International, and initially ran with trains built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company until 2007 when they were replaced with GCI's Millennium Flyer trains. Like many other GCI coasters, Wildcat contains a curved first drop to reduce chances of nausea. There is an on-ride camera located towards the end of the ride prior to the final brake run. The ride was known for being extremely rough and painful while operating with the original trains. After the ride was retrofitted with Millennium Flyer trains, guests and enthusiasts alike noticed that the ride was less painful but retained its original roughness. The Wildcat is located on a relatively large hill, causing it to appear much higher than it is in reality. In October, when Hersheypark is decorated in a Halloween theme, the Wildcat is dubbed the Scaredycat. <SP> Wildcat <S> amusement_parks.roller_coaster location.location amusement_parks.ride <S> Wildcat is the name of a wooden roller coaster located at Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut. It was built in 1927 and is the park's centerpiece. It is one of the world's oldest operating roller coasters. With a first drop of only 73 feet, it's not too intense making it popular with younger guests. The entire structure was rebuilt with new wood in 1985, and the last bunny hills were retracked in 2004. The Wildcat went down for refurbishment on September 17, 2006 and reopened for the 2007 operating season. During its refurbishment, the brake runs were completely removed and rebuilt with new magnetic brakes. The station also received air gates in the queue line and individual seat belts were added to each seat. The ride was retracked by Martin & Vleminckx. The Wildcat's trains were built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. Before the Wildcat was built, the Green Dragon Coaster used to stand in its place. It bears a striking resemblance to the now-defunct Wildcat roller coaster that used to reside at Elitch Gardens in Denver.

Following high school, he studied drama at Carnegie Tech., then found work in stock shows and in such repertory companies as the Long Wharf Theater and Washington's Arena Stage. On the sly, he earned a side income as a college acting coach. Married at this time, his wife bore him a daughter in 1969. Alison Tucker would later go on to become an actress, herself. Michael later hooked up with Jill Eikenberry at the Arena Stage and went on to appear in the play, The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail (1970). Jill, who stood a few inches taller, married the 5'4-1/2 Michael in 1973. Together, they have a son, Max Tucker. Unhampered by his short stature and slightly gnomish features, Michael found work in character parts, making great strides on stage in such productions as Moonchildren, with Jill, in 1972. He also worked in tandem with Joseph Papp in such classics as The Merry Wives of Windsor, The Comedy of Errors and Measure for Measure. He finally debuted on Broadway in a 1976 revival of Trelawny of the Wells, with Meryl Streep and John Lithgow. Two years later, he entered the realm of film and TV. Minor parts in Final Chapter: Walking Tall (1977) and Eyes of Laura Mars (1978) led to a breakthrough featured role in the critically-acclaimed movie, Diner (1982). Woody Allen took advantage of his talents and featured him in both The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985) and Radio Days (1987). 1986 proved a big year when both he and Jill were cast as Stuart Markowitz and Ann Kelsey, respectively, in the long-running law series, L.A. Law (1986), which ran for eight seasons. Nominated for three Emmy awards (Jill was nominated five times; neither won), their characters also married on the show.

Created by Simon Cowell, the show began in 2004 and has since aired annually from August/September until December. The show is produced by FremantleMedia's Thames and Cowell's production company SycoTV. It is broadcast on the ITV network in the United Kingdom and simulcast on TV3 in the Republic of Ireland, with spin-off behind-the-scenes show The Xtra Factor screened on ITV2. The X Factor refers to the undefinable something that makes for star quality. The show was devised as a replacement for the highly successful Pop Idol, which was put on indefinite hiatus after its second series, largely because Cowell, who was a judge on Pop Idol, wished to launch a show to which he owned the television rights. The perceived similarity between the two shows later became the subject of a legal dispute. The original judging panel consisted of Louis Walsh, Sharon Osbourne and Cowell. Brian Friedman replaced Walsh in series 4, which also saw Dannii Minogue join the panel.

What are the affected areas of Tropical Storm Danielle <SP> Tropical Storm Danielle <S> meteorology.tropical_cyclone <S> Tropical Storm Danielle was the only tropical storm to move through the Caribbean Sea in 1986. A short-lived cyclone, Danielle developed on September 7 to the east of the southern Lesser Antilles. Strengthening to peak winds of 60 mph, the storm moved through Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, where a rainband moved across the main island with hurricane-force gusts. Continuing westward, Danielle absorbed dry air from northern South America and dissipated on September 10. The threat of Danielle prompted gale warnings in Barbados as well as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On the former island, wind gusts reached 40 mph. On Saint Vincent, the winds caused a major power outage, while heavy rainfall left crop damage. Another rain system affected the country a few weeks later, and the combined monetary damage totaled $9.2 million; 142 people had to seek shelter after their homes were destroyed, and a total of 436 dwellings were impacted to some degree. In Trinidad and Tobago, the outer rainbands produced flooding and mudslides. Further west, Danielle briefly threatened Jamaica, although it dissipated before affecting the island. <SP> Tropical Storm Danielle <S> time.event meteorology.tropical_cyclone <S> Tropical Storm Danielle was a strong tropical storm that made landfall on Virginia in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season.

Two months since sixty-five thousand alien objects clenched around the Earth like a luminous fist, screaming to the heavens as the atmosphere burned them to ash. Two months since that moment of brief, bright surveillance by agents unknown. Two months of silence, while a world holds its breath. Now some half-derelict space probe, sparking fitfully past Neptune's orbit, hears a whisper from the edge of the solar system: a faint signal sweeping the cosmos like a lighthouse beam. Whatever's out there isn't talking to us. It's talking to some distant star, perhaps. Or perhaps to something closer, something en route. So who do you send to force introductions on an intelligence with motives unknown, maybe unknowable? Who do you send to meet the alien when the alien doesn't want to meet? You send a linguist with multiple personalities, her brain surgically partitioned into separate, sentient processing cores. You send a biologist so radically interfaced with machinery that he sees x-rays and tastes ultrasound, so compromised by grafts and splices he no longer feels his own flesh. You send a pacifist warrior in the faint hope she won't be needed, and the fainter one she'll do any good if she is. You send a monster to command them all, an extinct hominid predator once called vampire, recalled from the grave with the voodoo of recombinant genetics and the blood of sociopaths. And you send a synthesist--an informational topologist with half his mind gone--as an interface between here and there, a conduit through which the Dead Center might hope to understand the Bleeding Edge. You send them all to the edge of interstellar space, praying you can trust such freaks and retrofits with the fate of a world. You fear they may be more alien than the thing they've been sent to find. But you'd give anything for that to be true, if you only knew what was waiting for them...

What is locale for Monroe Street Bridge <SP> Monroe Street Bridge <S> architecture.structure transportation.bridge protected_sites.listed_site projects.project_focus location.location <S> Monroe Street Bridge is a deck arch bridge that spans the Spokane River in Spokane, Washington. It was built in 1911 by the city of Spokane and was designed by John Chester Ralston and Kirtland Kelsey Cutter. At the time of completion it was the largest concrete-arch bridge in the United States and the third longest in the world. The current bridge is actually the third bridge in this location. The first bridge, a rather rickety wooden structure, was built in 1889. The bridge was first closed due to arguments in the city over rights of passage and ownership. It then burned down in 1890 and then replaced with a steel bridge. The second bridge vibrated badly and had a noticeable dip in the center. A consultant from the Good Roads Movement considered the bridge unsafe in 1905. The design of the third bridge was largely copied from the Rocky River Bridge in Cleveland, Ohio, but was built one foot longer to make it the largest concrete arch in the United States at the time. The bridge was designed with ornamental features such as bison skulls, covered pavilions, and a chain-link railing motif.

A 1972 assassination attempt left Wallace paralyzed, and he used a wheelchair for the remainder of his life. He is remembered for his Southern populist and segregationist attitudes during the mid-20th century period of the African-American civil rights movement and activism, which gained passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s to enforce constitutional rights for all citizens.

He joined the Navy in 1936, got out in 1940, and then went right back in again when World War II started. A chief boatswain's mate, he ended up in Los Angeles after a total of eight years in the service. Wallace supported himself with an array of odd jobs, from working for a meat packer (knockin' steers in the head) to lumber-jacking in the High Sierras. A stint as a singing bartender attracted the attention of Hollywood columnist Jimmy Fidler, who helped him get his show-biz start. Wallace enrolled in drama school in the late 1940s, while earning his living tending the greens at MGM. He soon began landing jobs in films and TV, most notably as Commando Cody in the Republic serial Radar Men from the Moon (1952). He later made his Broadway debut in Richard Rodgers' Pipe Dreams, replaced John Raitt in The Pajama Game and was nominated for a Tony for his leading role in New Girl in Town with Gwen Verdon. Other stage roles have included The Unsinkable Molly Brown opposite Ginger Rogers, Jennie with Mary Martin, Most Happy Fella (during production, he met his present wife, actress Jane A. Johnston), Camelot (as King Arthur), Man of La Mancha, Company, and more.

He spent summers there until his death in 1912. The house was built about 1890 on the grounds of the Idlewild Hotel, which Furness had designed in 1886. This was a mile west of Lindenshade, the Wallingford summer house of his brother, Shakespearean scholar Horace Howard Furness. It was also a short walk to the Moylan-Rose Valley train station, which enabled him to commute to his architectural office in Philadelphia. Idlewild is constructed with a stone basement and brick first floor. The upper floors are framed in wood and clad with cedar shingles. It has a wrap-around covered porch, high-ceilinged rooms, and an irregular roofline with variously shaped windows and eyebrow dormers. Furness placed the service rooms and front and back stairs at the front. This increases the privacy of the rooms behind, and the visual interplay between the differing scales of the service tower and main house gives vibrancy to the fa莽ade.

Historically, the lake was spring-fed, and sat on the property of William Neil in North Columbus (then a city of its own, which would later be annexed by Columbus). The trustees in charge of purchasing land for the new Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (which would later become the Ohio State University) chose to purchase Mr. Neil's land after drinking from the spring. A German trustee reportedly stated It's hard to get a Dutchman away from a spring like that. The spring dried up in 1891 when the city of Columbus struck the source of the spring while installing a trunk sewer line through campus. The water source was subsequently provided by the city of Columbus municipal water supply, at a new location on campus near the location of the original lake. Visitors, students, faculty, and staff enjoy the fountains that run in spring, summer, and autumn.

Who is tv program creator of Family Matters <SP> Family Matters <S> broadcast.content award.nominated_work award.winning_work media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work ratings.rated_entity tv.program <S> A perfect spin-off from Perfect Strangers: Family Matters focused on Harriet Winslow (the elevator operator from the Chronicle) and her family of sorts. Carl Winslow, her husband, was a dutiful cop, and a gruff and lovable father to three kids: Eddie Winslow, the rebel son; Laura Winslow, the smart-aleck daughter; and cute little Judy Winslow. They had opened their home to Harriet's sister, Rachel Crawford and her little baby son Richie, and in the very first episode, Carl had to open his home to his cool and streetwise mother, Estelle Winslow, whether he wanted to or not. #R##N#Everything was going along just fine until one day, Steve Urkel, the inventive nerd, barged into their home and eventually, into their hearts. Steve had a killer crush on Laura, but she would never give him the time of day. Steve Urkel was intended to be a one-shot appearance, but his popularity with聽the fans won him the number-one spot as America's favorite nerd.#R##N#As the show went on, the characters and the stories evolved. Richie grew from a little baby into a rambunctious and impressionable little boy. The stories started revolving around Steve and his incredible inventions, which became the greatest sight gags on the show. In almost every episode, Steve ends up breaking furniture, windows, and Carl's patience. Eddie and Laura each had best buddies to hang out with: Eddie had dim-witted yet lovable Waldo Geraldo Faldo,and Laura had faithful and true-blue gal pal Maxine. The greatest mystery of Family Matters is Judy and Rachel's sudden disappearances from the show, but Rachel made guest appearances whenever possible.#R##N#To stop Steve from chasing her, Laura matched him up with perky-yet-pushy Myra Monkhouse. Steve loved Myra physically, but his emotions will always go to Laura. Eddie had his share of steady girlfriends, and even he had an Urkel chasing him- Myrtle May Urkel, Steve's cousin from Biloxi (Jaleel White also). Every so often, Steve uses one of his inventions to turn himself into debonair, irresistable lover Stefan Urquelle or karate hero Bruce Lee to draw Laura closer to him, much to Myra's chagrin.#R##N#At the end of season 6, the Winslows welcomed Steve into their home when Steve's family went to Russia. Pretty soon, Richie hung out with 3J, a tough, streetwise kid always running from the children's home. The Winslows then adopted 3J as one of their kids, as they did with Steve.#R##N#In the final season, Family Matters - along with Step by Step - moved to CBS, and Steve slowly matured from the annoying nerd that he used to be. This was when Laura started falling in love with Steve, and Myra got kicked to the curb, but she vowed to get her Stevie-kins back. Also, the original Harriette, JoMarie Peyton, had left the show in mid-season and Judyann Elder took her role. Steve and Laura got engaged, but they never had a wedding because CBS dropped the ax on the show. But, nevertheless, Family Matters had a great successful run and is one of the longest running African-American comedies ever. In Germany the show is known as Alle unter einem Dach (Under One Roof).#R##N#In Spain it is known as Cosas de casa.#R##N#In France it is known as La Vie de famille (Life of the Family).#R##N#In Italy it is known as Otto sotto un tetto (Eight Under One Roof).#R##N#In Sweden it is known as R茂驴陆kna med br茂驴陆k.#R##N#In Croatia it is known as ''Pod istim krovom'' <SP> Family Matters <S> tv.program <S> Family Matters is a Philippine TV Show and it airs Saturdays 5:30 am on TV5.

Nessus, like almost all Puppeteers ever met by humans, is insane by Puppeteer standards. Sane Puppeteers are far too cautious (cowardly from the human perspective) to go off-world or interact with non-Puppeteers, thus only insane individuals like Nessus can manage to act as business liaisons or ambassadors to other species, as he does with humans and others. Nessus demonstrates traits that in humans would be diagnosed as manic-depressive disorder, displacement, and at times, extreme suggestibility. His interactions with humans cause him to be one of the few Puppeteers to ever show any support for Human interests as coequal to Puppeteer interests.

As Fascism is on the march in Italy under the rule of Benito Mussolini, Golfiero Goffredo (Alessio Boni) is a well-respected movie director who is not afraid to share his left-wing views. While shooting his latest picture, Golfiero notices a beautiful woman working as an extra, Luisa Manfrini (Monica Bellucci), and he's immediately convinced she has star quality. Taking Luisa under his wing, Golfiero gives her a new name, Luisa Ferida, and begins grooming her for a new career as a cinema idol. As Luisa clicks with moviegoers, self-centered screen star Osvaldo Valenti (Luca Zingaretti) finds he's enamored of her, and the two become a couple both on and off screen. With Osvaldo at her side, Luisa abandons Golfiero as her mentor and the lovers becomes close friends with Cardi (Luigi Diberti), a loyal fascist who helps oversee the nationalized film industry. As Rome falls to Allied forces, Luisa and Osvaldo flee to still-Fascist Northern Italy, where they are welcomed as stars and attend a social event where they are guests of honor alongside Pietro Koch (Paolo Bonanni), well known as a go-between for the Italian and German forces. When Mussolini's reign is finally put down in Italy, Luisa and Osvaldo discover they have a great deal to answer for as they struggle to convince others that while they may have rubbed shoulders with Fascists and Nazis, they themselves were never Axis agents -- an argument that rings hollow when the two are charged with war crimes. Sanguepazzo (aka Wild Blood) was screened as a special presentation at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi
What is manufacturer for Wildcat <SP> Wildcat <S> location.location architecture.structure amusement_parks.roller_coaster amusement_parks.ride <S> Wildcat is a wooden roller coaster located at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania. It is located in the Midway America section of the park, just across from Wild Mouse. The ride was named after Wild Cat (Hersheypark), Hersheypark's first roller coaster, which operated from 1923 to 1945. Wildcat was also the first coaster built by Great Coasters International, and initially ran with trains built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company until 2007 when they were replaced with GCI's Millennium Flyer trains. Like many other GCI coasters, Wildcat contains a curved first drop to reduce chances of nausea. There is an on-ride camera located towards the end of the ride prior to the final brake run. The ride was known for being extremely rough and painful while operating with the original trains. After the ride was retrofitted with Millennium Flyer trains, guests and enthusiasts alike noticed that the ride was less painful but retained its original roughness. The Wildcat is located on a relatively large hill, causing it to appear much higher than it is in reality. In October, when Hersheypark is decorated in a Halloween theme, the Wildcat is dubbed the Scaredycat. <SP> Wildcat <S> amusement_parks.roller_coaster location.location amusement_parks.ride <S> Wildcat is the name of a wooden roller coaster located at Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut. It was built in 1927 and is the park's centerpiece. It is one of the world's oldest operating roller coasters. With a first drop of only 73 feet, it's not too intense making it popular with younger guests. The entire structure was rebuilt with new wood in 1985, and the last bunny hills were retracked in 2004. The Wildcat went down for refurbishment on September 17, 2006 and reopened for the 2007 operating season. During its refurbishment, the brake runs were completely removed and rebuilt with new magnetic brakes. The station also received air gates in the queue line and individual seat belts were added to each seat. The ride was retracked by Martin & Vleminckx. The Wildcat's trains were built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. Before the Wildcat was built, the Green Dragon Coaster used to stand in its place. It bears a striking resemblance to the now-defunct Wildcat roller coaster that used to reside at Elitch Gardens in Denver.

The film depicts the natural community of animals populating an old abandoned windmill in the country, and how they deal with a severe thunderstorm that nearly destroys their habitat. It incorporates the song One Day When We Were Young from` Johann Strauss II's operetta The Gypsy Baron. Like many of the later Silly Symphonies, The Old Mill was a testing-ground for advanced animation techniques. Marking the first use of Disney's multiplane camera, the film also incorporates realistic depictions of animal behavior, complex lighting and color effects, depictions of rain, wind, lightning, ripples, splashes and reflections, three-dimensional rotation of detailed objects, and the use of timing to produce specific dramatic and emotional effects. All of the lessons learned from making The Old Mill would subsequently be incorporated into Disney's feature-length animated films, especially 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

It was designed from the outset to accommodate rail, streetcar, automobile and pedestrian traffic. The bridge was designated a Municipal Historic Resource in 1995. Trucks are prohibited on the bridge due to the low clearance of 3.2 metres and substandard lane width, despite the bridge being classified as a 24-hour truck route on city maps. Currently street traffic is one-way southbound. At the north end of the bridge 109 Street becomes the left lane, and 110 Street becomes the right lane.

It has a slight central rise, and a somewhat darker floor that is nearly covered in overlapping swirl-like deposits. Much of the deposits are slumped or fall-back material. The inner walls are steep and free from impact erosion. Detailed examination of this crater have located what appear to be alcoves and channels along the inner rim. It is hypothesized that micrometeorite impacts along the rim trigger dry landslides, which produce a gully-like appearance. A similar phenomenon may be responsible for gully-like features along the inner rim of some Martian craters.

It starred Matthew Macfadyen, Damian Lewis and Ioan Gruffudd. The music was written by Debbie Wiseman. It was screened on BBC One. The series tells the story of a group of British peacekeepers serving in a peacekeeping operation of the UNPROFOR in Vitez, in Bosnia during the La拧va Valley ethnic cleansing in 1993. The film emphasises the contradictions of the mandate of the peacekeepers, and the psychological trauma that they sustain while being forced to observe atrocities perpetrated against civilians without being able to intervene, and being subject to deliberate provocations against which they are unable to retaliate. The ironic title of the programme is taken from the name of the armoured vehicle used by the British forces, the FV 510 Warrior.

A group of young Spanish army engineers is stationed in a Kosovo village to help the Albanians recover from the war's devastation. The unit is sent on a mission to restore electricity to a small town in hostile territory, but their operation is derailed when they get caught up in the fighting between Serb and Albanian paramilitaries. Struggling to stay neutral, the peacekeepers find themselves fighting for survival as they scamper around the Balkan countryside searching for a way back to headquarters. Their descent into the quagmire of ethnic fighting tests the limits of their idealism and underscores the moral complexities posed by humanitarian intervention. This polished actioner screened at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.

Where is the place of death of Lamont Young? <SP> Lamont Young <S> people.person people.deceased_person architecture.architect <S> Lamont Young was an Italian architect and urban planner from the late 19th and early 20th century. He was born in Naples and all of the works and urban design associated with his name are found in that city. In architecture, he is primarily associated with having constructed a number of pseudo-Victorian castles in the city, the most prominent of which is on the Corso Vittorio Emanuele overlooking the Chiaia section of town. In urban design, Young planned a mammoth rebuilding of the city of Naples in the 1880s, including the construction of an underground train line. Although the plan was initially approved, it eventually lost out to a competitor plan, known as the risanamento a more drastic version of urban surgery than even Young had planned and the one that was, over a 30-year period, responsible for the rebuilding of Naples before World War I. <SP> Lamont Young <S> people.deceased_person people.person <S> Lamont H. Young was an assistant geological surveyor for the New South Wales Mines Department. He mysteriously disappeared while on field-work at Bermagui, New South Wales. Young was inspecting the new goldfields at Bermagui in 1880. In order to investigate possible sites further north, Young and his assistant travelled on a small boat with the boat's owner, Thomas Towers of Batemans Bay, and two of Towers' friends. All five disappeared on 10 October. In the morning the boat was observed, but stationary and with apparently only one man on board. Later in the day the vessel was seen stranded on the rocks with no-one on board. The boat was found to contain five bags full of clothing, Young's books and papers, a bullet in its starboard side and some vomit. The men were not found despite subsequent searches, rewards, government inquiries and wide media coverage. The remnants of a fire, some food and three shirt studs were the only traces. The mystery was never solved. Unusual aspects of the wreck were that the planks of the boat were stove-out rather than stove-in, the boat contained several large rocks and the anchor and stern ropes were missing.

An extraordinary friendship grows among the unlikely trio, like a delicate flower blooming from a thorny cactus. <SP> Cactus Flower <S> award.nominated_work award.ranked_item award.winning_work broadcast.content film.film media_common.adaptation media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work ratings.rated_entity <S> Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for her performance as a Greenwich Village free spirit in Cactus Flower. Middle-aged dentist Winston (Walter Matthau) is enjoying an affair with Toni (Goldie Hawn) but doesn't want to be hemmed in by marriage. He prevails upon his non-glamorous assistant Stephanie (Ingrid Bergman) to pose as his wife so as to keep from campaigning for a ring. Then, to justify his infidelity, Winston talks his pal (Jack Weston) into pretending to be Stephanie's illicit lover. Flattered by all the attention, Stephanie begins to doll up. Confronted by a newly gorgeous Stephanie, Winston realizes that his Dream Girl has been right there in his office all along. As for Toni, she ends up in the arms of a writer (Rick Lenz), who has loved her since Reel One. Cactus Flower was adapted by Billy Wilder's frequent collaborator I.A.L. Diamond from the play by Abe Burrows -- which in turn was adapted from a French farce.

What is the catologe calue that corresponds to All Night Long? <SP> All Night Long <S> award.ranked_item award.nominated_work broadcast.content film.film media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work ratings.rated_entity <S> Gene Hackman plays a disgruntled suburbanite who manages the Ultra-Sav, an all-night drugstore. He hates his job, hates his debts and responsibilities, and isn't overly fond of his wife (Diane Ladd) and son (Dennis Quaid). Partly as a form of protest, Hackman enters into an affair with Barbra Streisand, one of his wife's distant relatives (don't ask how she's related - it takes Hackman about thirty seconds to explain it to another character). Streisand doesn't belong in this picture at all, but she can be forgiven her acting excesses because she wasn't the first choice for the role anyway (Lisa Eichhorn dropped out just before shooting began). The best moments in All Night Long involve the steady stream of oddballs and losers who trickle into Hackman's establishment. There is also a cute Apocalypse Now parody involving a battery-operated toy helicopter. The principal attraction of All Night Long is Gene Hackman playing an endearingly recognizable modern type. <SP> All Night Long <S> media_common.cataloged_instance ratings.rated_entity media_common.creative_work film.film broadcast.content award.ranked_item <S> All Night Long is Othello to a progressive-jazz beat.

McGoohan hopes that, by destroying Harris' marriage to Marti Stevens, he will be able to step into the bandleader's job himself. Keith Michel plays the Cassio counterpart, here creatively renamed Cass Michaels. Like 1957's Joe MacBeth, All Night Long is an amusing novelty, but hardly Shakespearean in calibre. Still, the film affords us the opportunity to watch jazz legends Dave Brubeck and Charles Mingus in action.

All, with the help from each other to get them through the obstacles that life naturally has for us. Monica is the excessively neat and organized older sister of the group, who works as a chef while yearning to find her ideal love. Ross, Monica's older brother, is a paleontologist with a lifelong crush on Rachel. He is a laid-back man with low self esteem and a recent divorcee. Rachel is the pretty, bubbly girl who spent most of her life as a spoiled聽rich princess. Now she must learn to face the real world. Chandler is Ross' college buddy and the guy who will crack jokes at a moment's notice. Phoebe is a lovable eccentric masseuse who easily could have fit in with Haight Ashbury in the 1960s.

These six individuals make up the cast of Friends. #R##N#In May 2004, Friends officially ended it's phenomenal 10 year run. The show's time slot was taken over by a spin-off called Joey.

Busoni prepared his own libretto, in German, based on the play by Count Carlo Gozzi. The music for Busoni's opera is based on the incidental music, and the associated Turandot Suite (BV 248), which Busoni had written in 1905 for a production of Gozzi's play. The opera is often performed as part of a double bill with Busoni's earlier one-act opera Arlecchino. <SP> Turandot <S> media_common.creative_work media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.unfinished_work music.composition opera.opera ratings.rated_entity <S> Turandot (/藞tj蕣蓹r蓹nd蓲t/; [turan藞d蓴t]; see below) is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini, completed by Franco Alfano, and set to a libretto in Italian by Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. Though Puccini's first interest in the subject was based on his reading of Friedrich Schiller's 1801 adaptation of the play, his work is most nearly based on the earlier text Turandot (1762) by Count Carlo Gozzi. The original story is based on one of the seven stories in the epic Haft Peykar (The Seven Beauties), a work of 12th-century Persian poet Nizami. Nizami aligned the seven stories with the seven days of the week, the seven colors and the seven corresponding planets. This particular story is the story of Tuesday, being told to King Bahram by his companion of the red dome, associated with Mars. In the very first line of this story, the protagonist is identified as a Russian princess. The name of the opera is based on Turan-Dokht (daughter of Turan), which is a common name used in Persian poetry for Central Asian princesses.

On November 9, 1716, Bellamy and his crew, sailing the sloop Mary Anne (or Marianne), attacked and captured the Antiguan sloop Bonetta, which was then en route from Antigua to Jamaica. John King, then aged between eight and eleven, was a passenger on the Bonetta. According to Abijah Savage, the Bonetta's commander, the pirates looted the ship for 15 days, during which time King demanded to join Bellamy's crew. (F)ar from being forced or compelled (to join), Savage wrote in his report, he declared he would kill himself if he was restrained, and even threatened his mother, who was then on board as a passenger and his father who did not like him. While teenage pirates were common in the 18th century, and though the Royal Navy employed young boys as powder monkeys to carry gunpowder from ship's magazine to their cannons, boys of King's age were unknown as pirates. However, after an initial show of defiance, Bellamy allowed King to join him. In the subsequent months, Bellamy and his crew would capture and loot many ships, including the Whydah in February 1717, a heavily armed slave galley which Bellamy claimed for his flagship. On April 26, 1717, the Whydah was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Cape Cod, killing Bellamy and most of his crew, including King.

What he thought was his stable marriage to high-end antiques gallery manager Ellen Moseby is not, when he finds out she has been having an affair. Although she still loves Harry, Ellen believes his work - especially having to do all his own legwork in his independent agency, as opposed to working for a larger private investigation firm - is overtaking his life and their marriage. This revelation is bad timing for Harry as he starts on a new case, to locate two-week missing sixteen-year-old Delly Grastner for her mother, twice-divorced Arlene Iverson, a former bit actress. Beyond the job itself, Harry can see that Arlene's motives are not motherly love. He eventually learns that Arlene, who lives well, achieved what little success she had in the business by sleeping with the right people, and that the probable reason that she wants Delly back is that her daughter's sizable trust fund set up by Arlene's first husband, Delly's late father, is Arlene's sole means of support. When Harry believes he discovers not only Delly's reasons for running away but also to where she was running in achieving her goal, he changes the complexity of the case solely from missing person to possibly smuggling, attempted murder and multiple homicide, which have far more inherent dangers to himself. All the while, he still grapples with what to do about the broken state of his marriage.

His opportunities at the City Ground were limited and after only four League appearances in three years, he was allowed to move to Preston North End where his career really took off. Although he did perform on the Nottingham Forest version of We've Got the Whole World in Our Hands. In five seasons at Deepdale he made 208 League appearances, scoring 70 goals, and it was this firepower that encouraged Luton manager David Pleat to invest 拢95,000 to bring him to Kenilworth Road in the summer of 1984. Although scoring within three minutes of the start of his debut against Stoke City on the opening day of 1984鈥?5, he struggled in an admittedly poor Luton side and was used in the part exchange deal that brought David Preece to Kenilworth Road from Walsall in December 1984. Elliott rediscovered his scoring boots at Fellows Park and after two successful years there he joined Bolton Wanderers for 拢25,000. At Burnden Park though, his scoring rate slowed a little as proved by a return of 11 in 60 appearances over two seasons.

At the age of 15 he met and befriended Lone Ranger artist Charles Flanders, who acted as a mentor and teacher to the budding artist. Infantino entered the comics industry in 1942, getting a job with Timely (now Marvel) comics as an illustrator on the Jack Frost title. He worked for several other publishers after graduating from art school, before finally landing at DC Comics. It was at DC that Infantino made his name. Superhero comics had all but disappeared in the early 50s, but DC was ready to begin a relaunch of this genre in 1956. DC editor/writer Julius Schwartz approached Infantino about his idea to both revive and revise the Flash. Schwartz' writing and Infantino's modernistic artwork helped make the Flash a big hit, and to also help usher what became known as the Silver Age of comics. Infantino went on to work on such characters as the Elongated Man, Adam Strange, and Batman. His work on the latter is credited with reviving that character's sagging sales. In 1967, Infantino was promoted to editor at DC Comics. He was influential in bringing a more modern look to the previously stodgy DC comics, and was the person who hired influential artist/writer Neal Adams. Infantino was promoted to publisher in 1971, then president of DC Comics in 1974. He left DC in 1976 after a dispute with DC's parent company Warner Communications. After leaving DC, Infantino briefly worked for Hanna-Barbera as a character designer, then taught for several years at the School of Visual Arts. Infantino is now retired, and resides in New York City. He is regarded as a living legend in the comics field. <SP> Carmine Infantino <S> book.author book.subject comic_books.creator comic_books.penciler event.agent fictional_universe.character_creator media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.subject people.deceased_person people.person ratings.rated_entity award.competitor award.nominee award.winner biology.organism <S> Carmine Michael Infantino (/藢瑟nf蓹n藞ti藧no蕣/; May 24, 1925 鈥?April 4, 2013) was an American comics artist and editor, primarily for DC Comics, during the late 1950s and early 1960s period known as the Silver Age of Comic Books.

Besides interviewing all the Best Actor and Best Actress Oscar nominees, the show also features an exclusive in-depth career profile and candid conversation with Sheehan's longtime pal Clint Eastwood, who is nominated for Best Director and Best Picture for Letters from Iwo Jima. David Sheehan is no stranger to TV firsts: In 1972, on KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, Sheehan was also the first commentator to ever critique television on television, drawing biting the hand feature articles in both Time and Life magazines. In 1975 he was the first local newsman to ever work for two networks simultaneously: appearing daily on America Alive on NBC and The Big News on CBS. In 1979 he hosted and produced the first Pay-TV monthly series in history, Backstage in Hollywood on HBO. Also in 1975 Sheehan also produced, wrote and hosted the first Pre-Oscar specials in the history of television with Oscar Hopefuls, Emmy Hopefuls and Grammy Hopefuls. In the early 1980s, Sheehan produced and camera directed Pippin, with Bob Fosse directing the choreography, and starring Ben Vereen and Martha Raye. Pippin was the first Broadway musical ever captured by cameras during live stage performance in history. Pippin still plays today on cable and Pay-TV and the DVD is currently on the musicals honor roll at home video stores and websites everywhere. In the 1980s, at NBC, Sheehan was the first local entertainment reporter to host and produce his own series of network specials, under the tutelage of then NBC president Don Ohlmeyer, including Macho Men of the Movies (with Clint Eastwood, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Hollywood's Leading Ladies (with Julia Roberts, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sharon Stone and Barbra Streisand). Sheehan worked the 70s and early 80s on KCBS-TV, moved to KNBC-TV from '84 to '94, and finished up his 33 years of daily newscasting back at KCBS-TV from 1994 to 2004.

Sheehan and his wife, actress Susan Angelo, live vagabond lives, residing primarily in Marina Del Rey, California, New York's upper west side, the Indianapolis-Bloomington area of Indiana and his hometown Columbus, Ohio. Sheehan's college education includes Ohio State University, The University of Notre Dame, and finally finishing up at UCLA. After college, Sheehan was a newspaperman with the United Press International syndicate, covering celebrities in politics and winning accolades for his insider reporting on Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack involvement in the 1962 John F. Kennedy presidential campaign. His magazine writing for Esquire, Playboy, Mademoiselle and Los Angeles Magazine included rare interviews with Tropic of Capricorn author Henry Miller, mental health pioneer Abraham Maslow, Gestalt Therapy founder Fritz Perls, and Zen interpreter Alan Watts. His articles on philosophers Michael and Dennis Murphy gave America its first view of the legendary 'Human Potentiality Movement' at Big Sur's Esalen Institute, which also took readers through an actual psychedelic experience guided by Sheehan's interview subjects Timothy Leary and Richard (Baba Ram Dass) Alpert. In the late 1960s, Sheehan was producer, actor and director of L.A.'s Theater Now Troupe, producing the West Coast Premieres of plays by Edward Albee, Norman Mailer and Jules Feiffer.

Only now a reckless killer has torn down the wall, trapping one very human woman in the supernatural cross fire. Robyn Peltier moved to Los Angeles after her young husband's sudden death, trying to put some distance between herself and her memories. Though she's still grieving, the challenges of her new life as the PR consultant to Portia Kane--the world's most famous celebutante wannabe--can sometimes be amusing, even distracting. But when her client is gunned down in the back room of a nightclub, Robyn is suddenly on the run as the prime suspect in the murder. And as more bodies pile up around her, it seems like only Hope Adams, Robyn's best friend, and Hope's somewhat spooky boyfriend Karl are on Robyn's side.

For Robyn has gotten herself in the middle of a turf war between two powerful Otherworld cabals who'll spill any amount of blood--human and inhuman--to protect what they consider theirs for all eternity.

His missionary ancestors were financially and culturally progressive-one even married a Hawaiian princess, making Matt a royal descendant and one of the state's largest landowners. Now his luck has changed. His two daughters are out of control: Ten-year-old Scottie is a smart-ass with a desperate need for attention, and seventeen-year-old Alex, a former model, is a recovering drug addict. Matt's charismatic, thrill-seeking, high-maintenance wife, Joanie, lies in a coma after a boat-racing accident and will soon be taken off life support. The Kings can hardly picture life without her, but as they come to terms with this tragedy, their sadness is mixed with a sense of freedom that shames them-and spurs them into surprising actions. Before honoring Joanie's living will, Matt must gather her friends and family to say their final goodbyes, a difficult situation made worse by the sudden discovery that there is one person who hasn't been told: the man with whom Joanie had been having an affair, quite possibly the one man she ever truly loved. Forced to examine what he owes not only to the living but to the dead, Matt takes to the road with his daughters to find his wife's lover, a memorable journey that leads to both painful revelations and unforeseen humor and growth.

It was the first successful show to pair a contestant with a celebrity partner and among the first to return after being cancelled several years. A retooled version of Password began in 1979 (as Password+Plus and later in 1984 as Super Password) enjoyed two more highly successful runs. This Password page, however, focuses on the 1961-1967 and 1971-1975 versions. Two contestants competed, each paired with a star partner that played the entire week. Host Allen Ludden gave one member of each team a password, and using 1-word clues only (proper nouns were accepted), it was the cluegiver's job to get his or her partner to guess the word for 10 points. If the 1st team didn't guess the word, the opposing team (who was allowed to eavesdrop) could try to聽successfully communicate the word with a new clue (or sometimes even the same clue) for 9 points. Play alternated until the word was guessed with 1 point deducted for each clue or until all 10 clues were given at Ludden's discretion (if it was obvious the word would never be guessed) or if the cluegiver accidentally uttered part or all of the password. Illegal clues 鈥?such as hyphenated words and clues with more than one word 鈥?and taking too much time also passed control to the opponents will be sounded by the buzzer from The Word Authority of Dr. Reason A. Goodwin--The Editor of World Book Encyclopedia Dictionary. Usually, the stars (who played the entire weekday) gave the clues on the 1st word of a game with the contestants trying to guess the word; then the contestants gave the clues and the celebrities tried to guess and so on. Play continued until 1 team scored 25 points (or on occassion, a time's up whistle sounded). The contestant won $100 on CBS Daytime and ($250 for the nighttime portion) and his or her team played the Lightning Round (believed to be the 1st endgame in a game show). In the Lightning Round, the celebrity partner was shown a series of 5 new passwords, one at a time. He or she had 60 seconds (1 Minute) to communicate all 5 to the contestant at $50 per correct guess of the word. An illegal clue or a pass meant no money could be earned on that word. Up to $250 was possible in the Lightning Round. Each contestant played 2 games after which they both retired; a contestant could win a maximum of $700. Even contestants who were shut out of any cash winnings were given a consolation gift (usually a camera or a set of World Book encyclopedias or other stuff). The most impressive contestants returned each year for a tournament of champions, but this was little more than asking them back to play two more games for $700 extra. The show debuted on the CBS daytime schedule on October 2, 1961 and continued through September 15, 1967; a nighttime Portion premiered on January 2, 1962 and had 2 runs up to May 22, 1967. Actress Betty White was a frequent guest star(and in June 1963, was a permanent fixture in Ludden's life ... as his wife); she appeared very frequently in all revivals of Password, long after Ludden's death on June 9, 1981; little wonder she was among the best players of this game. Reruns were syndicated to local stations after leaving CBS daytime (in part due to a naughty new game show called The Newlywed Game which was scheduled against Password) before reappearing on April 5, 1971 as a part of the ABC daytime schedule. Play was largely as before with modest cash payouts. That's until November 18, 1974, when the powers-that-be decided to change the game. An all-star edition 鈥?as Password All-Stars with 6 stars playing for charity 鈥?and a revised format with 4 contestants (2 of which were paired with a celebrity partner) competing for 2 spots in the main game were seen more as screwing up a good thing than changing it. Needless to say, the show would die of a quick death leaving ABC after an 5 season run on June 27, 1975. However, Goodson-Todman did make some changes that DID work, and showcased them in another revival called Password Plus, which debuted on January 8, 1979 on NBC (hosted originally by Ludden and later Bill Cullen and Tom Kennedy). That show remained until March 26, 1982, but it returned on September 24, 1984 as Super Password (hosted by Bert Convy) and it lived on NBC until March 24, 1989. See Password Plus and Super Password for more details.

One night in October when he was ten years old, Tyler Dupree stood in his back yard and watched the stars go out. They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier. He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout. It would shape their lives. The effect is worldwide. The sun is now a featureless disk--a heat source, rather than an astronomical object. The moon is gone, but tides remain. Not only have the world's artificial satellites fallen out of orbit, their recovered remains are pitted and aged, as though they'd been in space far longer than their known lifespans. As Tyler, Jason, and Diane grow up, a space probe reveals a bizarre truth: The barrier is artificial, generated by huge alien artifacts. Time is passing faster outside the barrier than inside--more than a hundred million years per year on Earth. At this rate, the death throes of the sun are only about forty years in our future. Jason, now a promising young scientist, devotes his life to working against this slow-moving apocalypse. Diane throws herself into hedonism, marrying a sinister cult leader who's forged a new religion out of the fears of the masses. Earth sends terraforming machines to Mars to let the onrush of time do its work, turning the planet green. Next they send humans...and immediately get back an emissary with thousands of years of stories to tell about the settling of Mars. Then Earth's probes reveal that an identical barrier has appeared around Mars. Jason, desperate, seeds near space with self-replicating machines that will scatter copies of themselves outward from the sun--and report back on what they find. Life on Earth is about to get much, much stranger. <SP> Spin <S> media_common.creative_work ratings.rated_entity award.ranked_item book.book book.written_work media_common.cataloged_instance <S> Go for a spin up a hill--when the story of a bike ride becomes an inspirational journey.

Originally built by John A. Miller in 1924, the ride's name was Pippin until 1967, when it changed to Thunderbolt beginning with the 1968 season, coinciding with an expansion of the track headed up by Andy Vettel. The all-wood coaster follows the surrounding terrain with a track length of 2,887 feet. Its maximum height is 70 feet, but because of the track layout and the natural ravines on which the ride is set, the maximum drop is 95 feet. Reaching a maximum speed of 55 mph, the ride takes 108 seconds to complete its circuit. An interesting feature of the Thunderbolt is that after departing from the station, the train does not immediately go up the lift hill as on most other coasters. Instead, the lift hill is in the middle of the ride. Most of the ride was left intact except for the double dip, station, and station turn-around to the first hill which were removed in 1968 for the addition of the new front helix hills necessary for the transformation of The Pippin into the new Thunderbolt roller coaster.

Michael Caine is Charlie Croker, a stylish robber and skirt-chaser just out of British prison. Shunning rehabilitation for recidivism, Croker takes over The Italian Job, a complicated plan to hijack gold bullion from Italy -- right from underneath the noses of the Italian Police and the Mafia. The job, whose original mastermind was murdered, clearly requires the sponsorship of a richer, more established criminal than Croker. He turns to the auspices of the eccentric Mr. Bridger (No毛l Coward in his last film role), a suave, regal, incarcerated English crime boss with a peculiar fascination with the Queen. Bridger provides Croker with a quirky group of Britain's most infamous computer hackers (including a lascivious Benny Hill), bank robbers, hijackers, and getaway drivers -- the ex-con is soon well on his way to relieving Italy of the gold. ~ Aubry Anne D'Arminio, Rovi

In 1942, Anatoly (Timofei Tribuntzev) was a sailor in the Russian Navy when his ship was captured by German troops and Anatoly was offered a terrible choice -- he would be allowed to live, but only if he would execute his commanding officer, Captain Tikhon (Aleksei Zelenski). Anatoly impulsively shot Tikhon, and thirty-four years later, Anatoly (now played by Pyotr Mamonov) is still punishing himself for this desperate act. Anatoly lives a Spartan existence in a tumble-down shack near a monastery, where he tends to the furnaces and serves Father Filaret (Viktor Sukhorukov), who lacks Anatoly's rigorous discipline of self-denial, and Father Job (Dmitry Dyuzhev), who treats his willing servant like a slave. While the staff at the monastery prefer not to acknowledge it, Anatoly has developed an unusual reputation in the village -- it's believed he has a gift of prophecy and can heal through faith, but while Anatoly is willing to use these talents, he will only do so for those who are willing to renounce all their worldly possessions and give their lives to the Lord.

When one of Erebus's wormships kills millions on the world of Klurhammon for no tactical reason and the AI entity controlling the lethal Jain technology attacks the Polity, Cormac has to figure out the reasons behind these sinister motives. When further attacks ensue, it brings some of the most dangerous individuals in the Polity to the front lines of the war. This includes Mr. Crane, the indefatigable brass killing machine who sets out for vengeance, and Orlandine, a vastly augmented haiman who herself controls Jain technology, seeks a weapon of appalling power, and finds allies in those who fought in an ancient war. With death and destruction on the horizon, Mika, the scientist and dragon expert, is kidnapped and forced to wake the makers of the Jain technology from their five-million-year slumber.

Formed in 1989 by frontman Marilyn Manson and Daisy Berkowitz, the group was originally named Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids with their theatrical performances gathering a local cult following in the early 1990s. The band's lineup has changed between many of their album releases; the current members of Marilyn Manson are the eponymous lead singer, bassist Twiggy Ramirez, guitarist Tyler Bates and drummer Gil Sharone. Until 1996, the name of each member was originally created by combining the first name of an iconic female sex symbol and the last name of an iconic serial killer. The members of the band dress in outlandish makeup and costumes, and have engaged in intentionally shocking behavior both onstage and off. In the past, their lyrics often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs. Their performances have frequently been called offensive and obscene, and, on several occasions, protests and petitions have led to the group being banned from performing. As this controversy began to wane throughout the 2000s, so did the band's mainstream popularity. <SP> Marilyn Manson <S> award.nominee music.artist music.composer music.engineer music.guitarist music.lyricist music.musician music.producer people.person ratings.rated_entity symbols.namesake tv.actor tv.crewmember tv.personality visual_art.visual_artist media_common.cataloged_instance award.winner biology.organism book.author celebrities.celebrity event.agent film.actor film.director film.music_contributor film.producer film.subject film.writer media_common.subject award.competitor <S> Marilyn Manson net worth: Marilyn Manson is an American singer-songwriter, musician, writer, actor, and artist who has a net worth of $25 million dollars.

He has released seven studio albums, and his lyrics and personal appearance have been the subject of much controversy. He was born Brian Hugh Warner (what an awesome first and last name btw鈥? on January 5, 1969, in Canton, Ohio, he made a name for himself on the world music stage with his controversial persona as the eponymous lead singer of the band Marilyn Manson. A controversy surrounds the sole formation of his stage name, which was created by juxtaposing the names of two American icons, particularly actress Marilyn Monroe and multiple murder conspiracy convict Charles Manson. Back in 1989, when Manson and guitarist Scott Putesky decided to form a band, they named the combo Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids.

Combining cultural criticism with memoir, high journalism, and selected correspondence, these texts belong to no particular genre, the prose being allowed to roam where it may, drawing from many strands, finding unexpected links, and collecting shrewd insights along the way. More than anything, they are exercises in exploration and self-clarification, wherein one will find, as work in progress, many of the themes that would later emerge in his orations. The Jonathan Bowden Collection aims at making these obscure texts readily available for the fi rst time, complete with annotations and indeces, so that they may be studied and / or enjoyed by present and future generations interested in the dissidents at the margins of British intellectual life at the turn of our century. Axe begins with the Right and ends with conservatism, but it is largely a commentary on art, literature, and intellectuals on the Left. Bowden begins with a criticism of Wyndham Lewis and then builds a catena of digressions, whose topics include Andrea Mantegna, J. G. Ballard, Stephen King, a foray into personal memoir, Jean Baudrillard, the New Left, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and Roberto D'Aubuisson. Throughout his commentary, Bowden compares the meaning and approaches of the Right against those of the Left in the intersection between modern politics and culture. This is not an essay in any conventional sense, but rather a succession of fervid and unpredictable snapshots that acrete into a grotesque panorama of Western civilisation in the 20th century.

After the multi-platinum success of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness and a subsequent yearlong world tour, follow-up Adore was considered one of the most anticipated albums of 1998 by MTV. Recording the album proved to be a challenge as the band members struggled with lingering interpersonal problems and musical uncertainty in the wake of three increasingly successful rock albums and the departure of drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Frontman Billy Corgan would later characterize Adore as a band falling apart. The result was a much more subdued and electronica-tinged sound that Greg Kot of Rolling Stone magazine called a complete break with the past. The album divided the fan base and sold only a fraction of the previous two albums. However, the album was well received by critics, and became the third straight Pumpkins album to be nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance.

In humans, the most important compounds in this group are vitamin D鈧?and vitamin D鈧? Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol can be ingested from the diet and from supplements. The body can also synthesize vitamin D in the skin, from cholesterol, when sun exposure is adequate. Synthesis from exposure to sunlight and intake from the diet generally contribute to the maintenance of adequate serum concentrations. Evidence indicates the synthesis of vitamin D from sun exposure is regulated by a negative feedback loop that prevents toxicity, but because of uncertainty about the cancer risk from sunlight, no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine, USA, for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin D requirements. Accordingly, the Dietary Reference Intake for vitamin D assumes no synthesis occurs and all of a person's vitamin D is from food intake, although that will rarely occur in practice. <SP> Vitamin D <S> medicine.drug medicine.medical_procedure medicine.medical_treatment chemistry.chemical_substance medicine.condition_prevention_factors <S> ERGOCALCIFEROL (er goe kal SIF e role) is a man made form of vitamin D.

Who is casting director of Little White Lies <SP> Little White Lies <S> film.film ratings.rated_entity media_common.creative_work media_common.cataloged_instance broadcast.content <S> Set in 1931 Germany, this gripping, beautifully executed feature foreshadows coming fascism through the microcosm of a school. Based on the novel by Anna Maria Joki, the film centers on Alexander, an A class student who accidentally damages a book he borrowed from a friend in the B class. Taking what seems like the easy way out, Alexander destroys the evidence and denies everything. But this seemingly harmless lie has devastating consequences when it becomes the basis for a hate campaign against the B class, ultimately hinting at situations far more serious than schoolyard politics. Atmospheric visuals鈥攕uch as gothic lighting, long, shadowy corridors, abandoned factories and dusty shops鈥攃reate a fable-like feeling that is both timeless and foreboding in this thought-provoking and highly engaging parable about how lies, big and small, can accumulate and create unexpected consequences.

What he thought was his stable marriage to high-end antiques gallery manager Ellen Moseby is not, when he finds out she has been having an affair. Although she still loves Harry, Ellen believes his work - especially having to do all his own legwork in his independent agency, as opposed to working for a larger private investigation firm - is overtaking his life and their marriage. This revelation is bad timing for Harry as he starts on a new case, to locate two-week missing sixteen-year-old Delly Grastner for her mother, twice-divorced Arlene Iverson, a former bit actress. Beyond the job itself, Harry can see that Arlene's motives are not motherly love. He eventually learns that Arlene, who lives well, achieved what little success she had in the business by sleeping with the right people, and that the probable reason that she wants Delly back is that her daughter's sizable trust fund set up by Arlene's first husband, Delly's late father, is Arlene's sole means of support. When Harry believes he discovers not only Delly's reasons for running away but also to where she was running in achieving her goal, he changes the complexity of the case solely from missing person to possibly smuggling, attempted murder and multiple homicide, which have far more inherent dangers to himself. All the while, he still grapples with what to do about the broken state of his marriage.

What is the outflow for Anderson Lake <SP> Anderson Lake <S> geography.lake geography.geographical_feature geography.body_of_water location.location ratings.rated_entity travel.tourist_attraction <S> Anderson Lake is located about 25 miles North of the town of Pemberton, British Columbia and is about 28.5 km虏 in area and around 21 km in length. Its maximum depth is 215 meters. It is drained by the Seton River, which feeds Seton Lake and so the Fraser River. It is fed by the Gates River, which drains from the Pemberton Pass divide with the Birkenhead River valley towards Pemberton-Mount Currie. It and Seton Lake were originally the same lake, which was cut in half between ten and twenty thousand years ago by a large landslide from the north face of the Cayoosh Range, which fronts Anderson Lake on the east. The slide created a locality known today as Seton Portage, which combined with the steamer Lady of The Lake played a key role on the route of the Douglas Road during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858-59. At its head, near the mouth of the Gates River, is the community of D'Arcy, the St'at'imcets name for which is N'quatqua.

Kennedy (1917鈥?963). Like his brother, Robert was extremely charming and a popular political figure during the 1960s. Tragically, much like his brother before him, Robert's assassination would leave behind many questions as to what could have been. Early life as a Kennedy Robert Francis Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, in Brookline, Massachusetts, to Joseph (1888鈥?969) and Rose (1890鈥?995) Kennedy. Robert enjoyed a privileged childhood and was surrounded by a loving and powerful family. Rose's father was the mayor of Boston. Joseph was a wealthy businessman and would later become U.S. ambassador, or official representative, to Great Britain. Kennedy's childhood was greatly shaped by his father's values. Joseph Sr. always wanted his children to try their hardest, no matter what they were doing. The Kennedys raised their children as Roman Catholics, and Robert was very religious throughout his young life and served as an altar boy. The seventh of nine children born to the Kennedys, Robert constantly sought the attention of his two older brothers, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. (1915鈥?944) and John F. Kennedy. Although slightly smaller than his brothers, Robert would develop the good looks and charm that would help the Kennedys win over the American public. The Kennedys lived in England during his father's ambassadorship and the family quickly became a favorite with the English press. In 1939, with the threat of war hanging over Europe, Joseph Kennedy sent his family back to America, fearing for their safety. Student and soldier Robert graduated from Milton Academy before entering Harvard. His college career was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II (1939鈥?5), in which the United States led the Allied forces against Germany, Japan, and Italy. After his oldest brother, Joseph, was killed in combat, Robert joined the navy and was assigned as a lieutenant. Later, he was assigned to the destroyer Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., which was named in honor of his brother. In 1946 he returned to Harvard, where he played football, and he graduated in 1948. He then earned his law degree from the University of Virginia Law School and was admitted to the Massachusetts bar (an association for lawyers) in 1951. While at school he met Ethel Skakel (1928鈥?, his sister's college roommate. Robert and Ethel were married in June 1950. They would have eleven children together (the last one was born six months after Kennedy's death). A political career begins In 1951 Kennedy joined the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. He resigned the following year to run John F. Kennedy's successful campaign for U.S. senator. In 1953 Robert was appointed one of fifteen assistant counsels, or advisors, to the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations under Senator Joseph McCarthy (1908鈥?957). At the time, McCarthy was leading a nationwide witch-hunt for Communists, or people who believe in a political system in which property and goods are owned by the government. McCarthy's movement gained momentum through America's fear of Communists living in the country. But later that year, Kennedy resigned when Democratic members of this subcommittee walked out in protest against McCarthy's forceful methods of investigation. Kennedy rejoined the Senate's permanent Subcommittee on Investigations as chief counsel for the Democratic minority in 1954. The following year, when the Democrats reorganized this committee under Senator George McClellan, Kennedy became chief counsel and staff director. That year the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce elected him one of ten outstanding young men. In 1955, at his own expense, Kennedy joined Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas (1898鈥?980) on a tour of several Soviet republics. (The republics were Communist states that made up the Soviet Union.) Kennedy became chief counsel to the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field organized under McClellan in 1957. His major accomplishment was the investigation of corruption, or dishonest activity, in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a powerful labor union. The hearings became front-page news, especially Kennedy's prosecution of the union's president, James Hoffa (1913鈥揷.1975). Some union leaders believed these hearings were more like persecution, or a public harassment, of Hoffa. Later, Kennedy was also responsible for several additional investigations of labor and management abuses. A Kennedy in the White House In 1960 Kennedy managed his brother's successful presidential campaign. When John appointed Robert U.S. attorney general, many cried nepotism, the act of favoring family members. But Robert's role in his brother's cabinet was unique, and he was virtually the president's other self. Shoulder to shoulder, the brothers stood together. The Kennedy administration carefully waded through civil rights cases, the growing Vietnam War (1955鈥?5; a civil war in which U.S. forces helped South Vietnam fight against a takeover by Communist forces from North Vietnam), and the Cuban missile crisis, when the nation held its breath as the president narrowly avoided conflict with Communist Cuba and the Soviet Union. Tragically, the partnership would not last. John F. Kennedy was killed by an assassin's bullet in Dallas, Texas, in 1963. Distressed by the loss of his brother, Robert soon resigned from the administration of President Lyndon Johnson (1908鈥?973). Kennedy ran successfully for New York State senator in 1964. Many wondered why Kennedy chose to run in New York instead of his native Virginia. Kennedy was thinking of the presidency by now, and Virginia was no power base. As a senator Kennedy achieved a splendid record, and his popularity began to grow and rival that of his brother's. Presidential candidate and a tragic ending Kennedy leaped into the presidential race in 1968. He was the perfect candidate to oppose Eugene McCarthy (1916鈥?. Kennedy's entrance bitterly divided liberal Democrats (those in favor of change). Kennedy won the support of activists as he had come to sympathize with the African Americans' drive for black power. He could reach and unite young people, activists, African Americans, and blue-collar Roman Catholics. Meanwhile, the white South hated him, big business distrusted him, and middle-class, reform Democrats were generally suspicious of him. Just after midnight on June 5, 1968, Kennedy was gunned down by an assassin. He died a day later. Robert Kennedy's tragic death robbed the nation of one of its most dedicated and popular politicians. For most of his life, Kennedy fought for equal rights, improving education, housing the poor, and many other issues of the day. Robert had been no copy of his brother John. In some ways he was more intense and more committed than his brother had been. Yet he shared John's personal philosophy that one man could make a difference.

It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. During the first two centuries of its existence the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance, from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula. By the following century it included North Africa, Spain, and what is now southern France. Two centuries after that, towards the end of the 1st century BC, it included the rest of modern France, Greece, and much of the eastern Mediterranean. By this time, internal tensions led to a series of civil wars, climaxing with the assassination of Julius Caesar, which ended with the establishment of the Roman Empire. The exact date of the transition to the Roman Empire can be a matter of interpretation.

It was ultimately nominated for three LA Weekly Theatre Awards, for Production Design, Original Musical Score, and Direction. Considered particularly noteworthy was the production's use of ample though non-exploitive full-frontal nudity, most particularly in scenes portraying ritualized pagan worship and, ultimately, the violent ritual killing of the character Pentheus, king of Thebes. A major contributing factor in the production's effectiveness was the movement scoring by choreographer Kim Weild, a master practitioner of the Suzuki method of dance/movement. The production was originally intended for a three-week run, but was extended by a full seven weeks for a total of ten weeks of performances. The show was videotaped for the Lincoln Center's Library of Performing Arts, now housed at the New York Public Library. It was also heavily attended by representatives from Actor's Equity, due to the widespread discussion regarding the production's heavy nudity in the second act.

How could Jesus鈥攚ho preached righteousness before God, and love and mercy toward neighbors鈥攂e so hated and pursued? To the Temple officials, he was a threat to the livelihood and authority of the priesthood. To Herod Antipas, he was a threat to his ambition to be the King of the Jews. And to the Roman overlords, he was seen as a dangerous threat; a man who commanded an army of the common people. He could heal wounds, offer miraculous provisions, and even raise from the dead. If Jesus had accepted popular acclaim and become an earthly king, he would have been unstoppable. Jesus鈥檚 last days are explored through three people who interacted with him: Governor Pilate, for whom Judea will either make or break his career; Pilate鈥檚 wife, Claudia, desperately seeking aid for her much loved, crippled son; and Centurion Marcus Longinus, caught in the middle between loyalty to the Empire, love for Claudia, and an ever-increasing belief in Jesus as the Son of God. After encountering Jesus, none of them will ever be the same. <SP> Behold the Man <S> ratings.rated_entity media_common.creative_work media_common.cataloged_instance fictional_universe.work_of_fiction award.winning_work award.nominated_work award.ranked_item book.book book.published_work book.written_work book.short_story <S> An omnibus volume of three science fiction novels on the theme of messianic complexes, includes BEHOLD THE MAN, BREAKFAST IN THE RUINS and CONSTANT FIRE.

Who is tv program creator of Password <SP> Password <S> tv.program <S> Password was a panel game show based on the US version of the same name. It was originally aired on ITV produced by ATV from 12 March to 10 September 1963 hosted by Shaw Taylor, then it aired on BBC2 from 24 March to 28 April 1973 hosted by Brian Redhead before moving to its flagship channel BBC1 from 7 January 1974 to 1976 first hosted by Eleanor Summerfield then by Esther Rantzen, it was then aired on Channel 4 produced by Thames from 6 November 1982 to 14 May 1983 hosted by Tom O'Connor and then finally aired back on ITV produced by Ulster from 22 July 1987 to 5 August 1988 hosted by Gordon Burns. <SP> Password <S> award.nominated_work award.winning_work broadcast.content media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work ratings.rated_entity tv.program <S> Password was a simple word-association game, but became one of the most popular and beloved game shows of all time. It was the first successful show to pair a contestant with a celebrity partner and among the first to return after being cancelled several years. A retooled version of Password began in 1979 (as Password+Plus and later in 1984 as Super Password) enjoyed two more highly successful runs. This Password page, however, focuses on the 1961-1967 and 1971-1975 versions. Two contestants competed, each paired with a star partner that played the entire week. Host Allen Ludden gave one member of each team a password, and using 1-word clues only (proper nouns were accepted), it was the cluegiver's job to get his or her partner to guess the word for 10 points. If the 1st team didn't guess the word, the opposing team (who was allowed to eavesdrop) could try to聽successfully communicate the word with a new clue (or sometimes even the same clue) for 9 points. Play alternated until the word was guessed with 1 point deducted for each clue or until all 10 clues were given at Ludden's discretion (if it was obvious the word would never be guessed) or if the cluegiver accidentally uttered part or all of the password. Illegal clues 鈥?such as hyphenated words and clues with more than one word 鈥?and taking too much time also passed control to the opponents will be sounded by the buzzer from The Word Authority of Dr. Reason A. Goodwin--The Editor of World Book Encyclopedia Dictionary. Usually, the stars (who played the entire weekday) gave the clues on the 1st word of a game with the contestants trying to guess the word; then the contestants gave the clues and the celebrities tried to guess and so on. Play continued until 1 team scored 25 points (or on occassion, a time's up whistle sounded). The contestant won $100 on CBS Daytime and ($250 for the nighttime portion) and his or her team played the Lightning Round (believed to be the 1st endgame in a game show). In the Lightning Round, the celebrity partner was shown a series of 5 new passwords, one at a time. He or she had 60 seconds (1 Minute) to communicate all 5 to the contestant at $50 per correct guess of the word. An illegal clue or a pass meant no money could be earned on that word. Up to $250 was possible in the Lightning Round. Each contestant played 2 games after which they both retired; a contestant could win a maximum of $700. Even contestants who were shut out of any cash winnings were given a consolation gift (usually a camera or a set of World Book encyclopedias or other stuff). The most impressive contestants returned each year for a tournament of champions, but this was little more than asking them back to play two more games for $700 extra. The show debuted on the CBS daytime schedule on October 2, 1961 and continued through September 15, 1967; a nighttime Portion premiered on January 2, 1962 and had 2 runs up to May 22, 1967. Actress Betty White was a frequent guest star(and in June 1963, was a permanent fixture in Ludden's life ... as his wife); she appeared very frequently in all revivals of Password, long after Ludden's death on June 9, 1981; little wonder she was among the best players of this game. Reruns were syndicated to local stations after leaving CBS daytime (in part due to a naughty new game show called The Newlywed Game which was scheduled against Password) before reappearing on April 5, 1971 as a part of the ABC daytime schedule. Play was largely as before with modest cash payouts. That's until November 18, 1974, when the powers-that-be decided to change the game. An all-star edition 鈥?as Password All-Stars with 6 stars playing for charity 鈥?and a revised format with 4 contestants (2 of which were paired with a celebrity partner) competing for 2 spots in the main game were seen more as screwing up a good thing than changing it. Needless to say, the show would die of a quick death leaving ABC after an 5 season run on June 27, 1975. However, Goodson-Todman did make some changes that DID work, and showcased them in another revival called Password Plus, which debuted on January 8, 1979 on NBC (hosted originally by Ludden and later Bill Cullen and Tom Kennedy). That show remained until March 26, 1982, but it returned on September 24, 1984 as Super Password (hosted by Bert Convy) and it lived on NBC until March 24, 1989. See Password Plus and Super Password for more details.

Taking off in her car, Ana watches in horror as the city becomes a virtual 'hellzone' as people begin to feed upon people, until she crashes her vehicle.

Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter, Edie (or, as they are called by the brothers, Big Edie and Little Edie), are aunt and cousin to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. In the early '70s, their 28-room mansion in Long Island's tony community of East Hampton was found to be a health hazard, and the two women, in their seventies and fifties, were threatened with eviction. Jacqueline Onassis paid for the house to be put in good order, and two years later, the Maysles paid the ladies a series of follow-up visits. This is not fly-on-the-wall filmmaking; the brothers are sometimes shown on-camera, and both women talk directly to them. Big Edie reminisces about her husband (from whom she has long been separated) and her youthful singing career; Little Edie ruminates over memories of her thwarted romances and confides that she has to get out of Grey Gardens (the name of their estate), although she has been living there since 1952; and the two women pick at each other for transgressions past and present. The women share their home with at least five cats and several raccoons, for whom Little Edie leaves out food in the attic. They are not recluses; they host a modest 79th birthday party for Big Edie, they employ a gardener, and they are often visited by Jerry, a young handyman/lost soul whom Little Edie calls the Marble Faun, after the Nathaniel Hawthorne story. It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present, Little Edie says near the beginning of the film, and it becomes clear that both women are much more comfortable reliving their respective youths (in some ways, Little Edie has never left hers) than facing their rather bleak old and middle age.

What is the affected area of Hurricane Nate <SP> Hurricane Nate <S> meteorology.tropical_cyclone time.event <S> Hurricane Nate was an Atlantic hurricane that threatened Bermuda but remained at sea during early September 2005. The fourteenth named storm and seventh hurricane of the annual Atlantic hurricane season, Nate formed southwest of Bermuda on September 5 and initially moved very slowly to the northeast. Early forecasts suggested a possible threat to the island, but Nate passed well to its south as a Category 1 hurricane on September 8. After moving away from the island, the storm entered a region with cooler sea surface temperatures and unfavorable wind shear, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm before becoming extratropical on September 10. The extratropical remnant was later absorbed by a larger weather system. The hurricane caused no structural damage while tropical, although it generated rip currents in combination with other storms that killed one person off the New Jersey coast. Nate dropped light rainfall and produced gusty winds on the island of Bermuda. The remnants of hurricanes Nate and Maria contributed to heavy rainfall in parts of Scotland and later Western Norway, triggering a mudslide that killed one person. <SP> Hurricane Nate <S> meteorology.tropical_cyclone <S> Hurricane Nate caused minor damage in southeastern Mexico in mid-September 2011. The sixteenth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Nate originated from a frontal trough in the Bay of Campeche on September 7. Within a weak steering environment, the storm meandered southwestward while gradually gaining strength. Though classified as a tropical storm operationally, data during a post-season review indicated that Nate briefly attained Category 1 hurricane status on the Saffir鈥揝impson hurricane wind scale on September 8. As a result of its slow motion, the storm caused significant upwelling, leading to a marked decrease in convection, and weakening accordingly. On September 11, Nate moved ashore Mexico as a tropical storm, producing several inches of rainfall and damaging several hundred structures. Ten oil rig workers went missing; seven were rescued, but one died of an unknown cause, and three other bodies were later recovered. In Veracruz, a boy was killed after being struck by lightning.

Designed by Foster & Partners, for then owner Trafalgar House, the plan was for the building to be the tallest in Europe and the sixth tallest in the world at that time, behind the twin Petronas Towers in Malaysia, the Sears Tower in Chicago, and the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York. Its height was planned at 386 metres, with 92 floors, which means it would have been 21st in the world today, and would be overtaken in Europe by the Federation Tower. A public viewing platform was planned for 1000 ft above ground level. The scheme featured a highly unorthodox floor layout, essentially two asymmetrical ellipses joined at one end. When the plans were first unveiled in 1996, the Guardian newspaper coined the term erotic gherkin, a name that was quickly taken up by other media and which stuck even after the plan was superseded, eventually becoming The Gherkin, the popular name for the different design of building that stands on the site today.

In high school, Kyle's short films got him accepted into the prestigious School of Visual Arts in NYC where he expanded into animation, documentaries, music videos, freelance editing, and ultimately feature films. Kyle's first feature length documentary Mumford's Law was a five year labor of love about a family's journey to grow beyond their troubled history, to achieve love, understanding and acceptance. His first feature film, an edgy romantic drama called His Naked Mind began as a project while Kyle was still a student. In fact, technically it was his thesis film. But when it swept the School of Visual Arts Dusty Awards for Best Editing, Best Cinematography, and Best Director, Kyle managed to raise the bar of what a thesis film could be to a whole new level. A voice as strong and unique and visually compelling as Kyle's is rare in general, and at only 23 years of age, one can just imagine the journey on which this natural born filmmaker will take his audience over the coming years. And it may not be too long before we find out, as Kyle has three new features he is actively developing. <SP> Kyle Mumford <S> biology.organism event.agent film.actor people.person <S> Kyle Mumford is an actor and editor, known for Paradiddle (2013).

What mountain range does Whistler Mountain belong to <SP> Whistler Mountain <S> geography.geographical_feature geography.mountain location.location ratings.rated_entity travel.tourist_attraction <S> Whistler Mountain is a mountain in the Fitzsimmons Range of the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains, located on the northwestern edge of Garibaldi Provincial Park. It is the location of the Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort and the town of Whistler, British Columbia. The original name of the mountain was London Mountain, named after a mining claim in the area. The locality was called Alta Lake before the creation of the Resort Municipality of Whistler in the 1970s, but the mountain's name had already been changed in 1965 as the associations with London's bad weather were deemed to be bad for advertising purposes. With the advent of the ski resort in the late 1960s the name was changed to Whistler to represent the whistling calls of the marmots, which are also known as whistlers, that live in the alpine areas of the mountain. Because of the mountain's proximity to Garibaldi Provincial Park, ski lifts are regularly used to quickly access the alpine, and ski tour into the park. The summit is home to the Whistler Peak chair, and this makes it one of the most traveled summits in BC.

A few days after settling into town, Vianne opens up a confectionery shop across the street from the house of worship -- shortly after the beginning of Lent. While the townspeople are supposed to be abstaining from worldly pleasures, Vianne tempts them with unusual and delicious chocolate creations, using her expert touch to create just the right candy to break down each customer's resistance.

Anything can happen within the next half hour!#R##N#These were the words spoken by Commander Shore at the beginning of each episode of Stingray, the first Gerry Anderson Supermarionation show to be made in colour.#R##N#Set in the year 2064, Stingray is about the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP) who patrol the world's oceans, helping and defeating underwater races. The pride of WASP is the revolutionary submarine Stingray, which is controlled by Captain Troy Tempest and Lieutenant George Lee Sheridan, better known as Phones.#R##N#The WASP headquarters at Marineville, a huge complex, 10 miles inland. The heart of WASP operations is the control tower, where Commander Sam Shore, Lt. Atlanta Shore (also his daughter) and Sub-Lieutenant Fisher can control and communicate with the entire WASP organization.#R##N#When Marineville is under surface attack, Battle Stations sound.

Buckingham Palace. Trafalgar Square. St Paul's Cathedral. Piccadilly Circus. The London that the world knows. But there is another side to London that remains unknown to the tourists, that emerges only at night, that comes alive in aging terraced houses and sprawling estates. It is a world of pills of dubious origin swallowed hurriedly and hopefully, of music with a thumping beat that you'll still hear when you wake up the morning after, of Rizla papers bought from an all-night garage, of bottles of mineral water shared as love tokens, of greasy kebabs eaten when the taste-buds have long since numbed, of sunrises viewed through stinging eyes. It is close to heaven, but it is very close to hell. For Rat, a fifteen year-old drug dealer, it is the only world he knows. Over one night Rat's world turns upside down as he finds himself on the run from older, far more serious criminals. We follow Rat as he looks for shelter with those he thinks he can trust. As each door closes on him, the likelihood of ever seeing the light of day again grows smaller.

What is sequel to Modesty Blaise? <SP> Modesty Blaise <S> award.nominated_work award.ranked_item broadcast.content film.film media_common.adaptation media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work ratings.rated_entity <S> A popular British comic strip series served as inspiration for this light-hearted espionage adventure, which if nothing else certainly shows the marks of its origins in the mid-1960s. A large departure for director Joseph Losey, better known for brooding interpretations of Harold Pinter works (The Servant, Accident), the film is emphatically bright and colorful, taking on at times a nearly psychedelic feel. The strangeness is emphasized by the unusual casting, including Italian star Monica Vitti in her first English-speaking role as the title character and Dirk Bogarde, playing against type as her arch-nemesis. Essentially everything is played for its camp value, including the rather convoluted, James Bond-like plot, which concerns the hijacking of a shipment of diamonds heading for the Middle East. Like its mod-era sets and costumes, this unusual, inconsistent effort is certainly intriguing and attractive, but might seem rather dated to some. <SP> Modesty Blaise <S> media_common.cataloged_instance film.film media_common.creative_work ratings.rated_entity tv.program <S> Modesty Blaise was a 1982 American-produced one-hour television pilot produced for the ABC Network and based upon the comic strip Modesty Blaise, created by Peter O'Donnell. This was the second attempt at adapting the comic strip as a live-action production, following a 1966 film of the same title. It was written by Stephen Zito, directed by Reza Badigi, with Barney Rosenzweig as executive producer. The plot has a few elements taken from O'Donnell's first Modesty Blaise novel (which in turn had been a novelization of a practically unused screenplay that Peter O'Donnell had written for the first Modesty Blaise film) but is largely original. Whereas Modesty in the comic strip and novels was said to be of uncertain Eastern European ancestry (but adopted England as her homeland), and her companion Willie Garvin was a Cockney, the telefilm makes both characters American.

A police procedural, a thriller against time, a race between hunted and hunter, and a whydunnit, written from multiple points of view that explore several apparently parallel stories which finally meet. Alex Prevost--kidnapped, savagely beaten, suspended from the ceiling of an abandoned warehouse in a tiny wooden cage--is running out of time. Her abductor appears to want only to watch her die. Will hunger, thirst, or the rats get her first? Apart from a shaky eyewitness report of the abduction, Police Commandant Camille Verhoeven has nothing to go on: no suspect, no leads, and no family or friends anxious to find a missing loved one. The diminutive and brilliant detective knows from bitter experience the urgency of finding the missing woman as quickly as possible--but first he must understand more about her. As he uncovers the details of the young woman's singular history, Camille is forced to acknowledge that the person he seeks is no ordinary victim. She is beautiful, yes, but also extremely tough and resourceful. Before long, saving Alex's life will be the least of Commandant Verhoeven's considerable challenges.

The Years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present鈥攅ven projections into the future鈥攑hotos, books, songs, radio, television and decades of advertising, headlines, contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from six decades of diaries. Local dialect, words of the times, slogans, brands and names for the ever-proliferating objects, are given voice here. The voice we recognize as the author's continually dissolves and re-emerges. Ernaux makes the passage of time palpable. Time itself, inexorable, narrates its own course, consigning all other narrators to anonymity. A new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective. On its 2008 publication in France, The Years came as a surprise. Though Ernaux had for years been hailed as a beloved, bestselling and award-winning author, The Years was in many ways a departure: both an intimate memoir written by entire generations, and a story of generations telling a very personal story. Like the generation before hers, the narrator eschews the I for the we (or they, or one) as if collective life were inextricably intertwined with a private life that in her parents' generation ceased to exist. She writes of her parents' generation (and could be writing of her own book): From a common fund of hunger and fear, everything was told in the we and impersonal pronouns.
