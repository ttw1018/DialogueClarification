They're mainly about different and interesting characters who are often like us.I have always been interested in people and their stories. As a result, in 2001, I became involved in the founding of a small non-profit effort to record the life histories of our Veterans (see www.nvharchive.org).A spin off of the NVHA has been a monthly column that I write in the Anderson Herald Bulletin to share some of these priceless stories of our nation's finest.

In awe of seductive club singer Velma Kelly (who is subsequantly arrested for the murder of her husband and sister - after discovering their affair), Roxie meets Fred Cassely a man who convinces her he can 'make her showbiz career take off'. However after Roxie has undergone the 'casting couch' treatment, and Fred has had his wicked way with her, he reveals that he has no more connections in showbusiness than she does. This is the final straw for Roxie, and her constant anger at rejection explodes. She shoots Fred Cassely and kills him. Upon discovering her infidelity, Roxie's husband Amos refuses to take the blame for the murder and Roxie is sent to jail, pending hanging. In jail she finally meets tabloid darling Velma Kelly, currently receiving huge media attention for the double murder she committed earlier in the tale. Sharing the clink with Velma, are a collection of other sly females, all awaiting trial for the murders of their own partners. Velma is aloof to Roxie, however the prison Warden Mrs Morton offers Roxie the opportunity of representation by slick Chicago lawyer Billy Flynn. Billy is more a showbiz P. R agent than a legal lawyer and minipulates the tabloids into thinking Roxie is no more than an innocent 'good time girl' who took the wrong path, than a scheming murderess. The tabloids go crazy for the new girl on the cell block, and Roxie finally becomes a star. However due to Roxie's new found fame, Velma is forgotten about.

But still, he started enjoying more commercial publicity after he started designing domestic products sold at Target stores in the United States. Born on July 9, 1934 in Indianapolis, Indiana, he earned his Bachelor's degree in Architecture from the University of Cincinnati and then took his Master of Architecture in Harvard University Graduate School of Design. A devoted student as he was, Graves was the recipient of the Prix de Rome that allowed him to learn the language of architecture for two years in Rome. Subsequently, he accepted a teaching position at Princeton University, after which he became a visiting professor at various prestigious universities. In this period, he also published several books on his teachings and works like The Swedish Connection, The Necessity of Drawing: Tangible Speculation and Le Corbusier's Drawn References. Graves rose to prominence once he joined the New York Five, a group of five New York City architects whose designs was featured by Committee of Architects for the Study of the Environment (CASE) at the Museum of Modern Art in 1969. Michael Graves adopted postmodernism in his architectural designs that are around 150 in total.

It is primarily used in assisted reproduction to control ovulation. The drug works by blocking the action of GnRH upon the pituitary, thus rapidly suppressing the production and action of LH and FSH. Ganirelix is used in fertility treatment to prevent premature ovulation that could result in the harvesting of eggs that are too immature to be used in procedures such as in vitro fertilisation. GnRH agonists are also sometimes used in reproductive therapy, as well as to treat disorders involving sex-steroid hormones, such as endometriosis. One advantage of using GnRH antagonists is that repeated administration of GnRH agonists results in decreased levels of gonadotropins and sex steroids due to desensitization of the pituitary. This is avoided when using GnRH antagonists such as Ganirelix. The success of Ganirelix in reproductive therapy has been shown to be comparable to that when using GnRH agonists.

A prolific painter in high school, he originally considered a career in fine art or illustration; however, he was also greatly inspired by stop-motion films such as the original King Kong and the Ray Harryhausen movies. Deciding that stop-motion was the ultimate art form, Joel decided to experiment with that medium and teach himself how to do it by focusing on animation instead of painting. College was not a viable option; therefore, he supported his independent filmmaking projects by working as a carpenter, waiter, and picture framer. In 1981, he managed to get a special filmmaking grant from the University of Wisconsin's Board of Regents. The grant helped to cover the production costs of his next project, done in the 16mm format, which took two years of spare time to complete. Entitled Fantascenes, it featured various avant-garde animated and live action short films and was broadcast by PBS station WHA-TV. Due to limited opportunities in Wisconsin, Fletcher moved to Los Angeles in 1985 to further his dream of becoming a professional stop-motion animator. Not having any industry contacts, he found that finding work in the movie business was a struggle but his persistence paid off. Since animation jobs were not consistently available, he occasionally took on other gigs as a model maker, sculptor, and prop fabricator. Joel's skill and experience grew from on-the-job experience as well as learning from many great artists and directors of feature films, television, and commercial projects. He became an avid 3-D stereo photographer and often used that skill to document the various movie productions in which he was involved. During this period he met his wife, Cheryl, an entertainment industry production accountant. They married in 1993 and had their daughter, Caroline, a year later. During 1994, sensing that digital animation was the way of the future, Joel bought a Macintosh computer and taught himself the basics of CGI through trial and error experimentation. His efforts succeeded as he joined the fledgling computer animation division at Disney a year later. That gig lasted nearly six years during which time Joel became a supervising animator and mentor in Disney's rapidly- expanding CGI division. Leaving Disney in 2001, he decided to offer his professional services only as a computer character animator rather than as a manager or animation supervisor because animating gave him the most personal satisfaction. Joel continued on as a freelancer not only on movie and TV projects but also other fields of animation such as game cinematics and theme park attractions. He spent the better part of 2004-2005 living in New Zealand and working for Peter Jackson's Weta Digital then returned to Los Angeles where he continued to animate a variety of projects to this very day. In 2006, Fletcher launched his website to showcase his various art and animation undertakings and share his behind the scenes tales. Later, feeling a personal loss from his inactivity in the traditional arts, Joel took up canvas painting during his spare time. After he retires from the entertainment industry, his goal is to eventually start a new career as a fine artist.", "label": "0", "context": "what is period for Joel Fletcher?"}

She's never been able to see her lush forest home, but she knows its secrets. She knows how the shadows shift when she passes under a canopy of trees. She knows how to hide in the cool, damp caves when the Scourge comes. She knows how devious and arrogant the Groundlings' tree-dwelling neighbors, the Lofties, can be. And she's always known this day would come--the day she faces the Scourge alone. The Sightless, like Fenn, are mysteriously protected from the Scourge, the gruesome creatures roaming the forests, reeking of festering flesh and consuming anything--and anyone--living. A Sightless Groundling must brave the Scourge and bring fresh water to the people of the forest. Today, that task becomes Fenn's. Fenn will have a Lofty Keeper, Peree, as her companion. Everyone knows the Lofties wouldn't hesitate to shoot an arrow through the back of an unsuspecting Groundling like Fenn, but Peree seems different. A boy with warm, rough hands who smells like summer, he is surprisingly kind and thoughtful. Although Fenn knows his people are treacherous, she finds herself wanting to trust him. As their forest community teeters on the brink of war, Fenn and Peree must learn to work together to survive the Scourge and ensure their people's survival. But when Fenn uncovers a secret that shatters her truths, she's forced to decide who and what to protect--her people, her growing love for Peree, or the elusive dream of lasting peace in the forest.

Soon after Loretta learned that down in the basement of the house, Freddy had a secret room where he kept many different tools of torture, newspaper clippings, versions of his famous glove, and more. Promising that she won't tell, she was strangled to death by Freddy in front of a 6-year old Kathryn for snooping in daddy's special work. In 1966, Freddy was arrested for the murders of the missing children and Kathryn was put into foster care and was later adopted by the Burroughs family. Her records were subsequently sealed and she was moved away from Springwood.     [edit] Freddy's search for his progenyAfter a decade of slaughtering all the children of Springwood in their dreams, there were no children left. The remaining adults were kept in a mass psychosis after their children had been murdered. When there was no one left to kill, Freddy sought to leave Springwood\u2014 hoping to continue his murder spree in another town, full of more children. Only one person could arrange for this\u2014 his long-lost daughter, Kathryn.

She took him back to Springwood to find answers about his past. Before John Doe died by Freddy's hands, he revealed to Maggie that Freddy didn't have a son. Later, Maggie had a dream of her past about her family, in which she met Freddy, who revealed to her that she was his daughter. After she woke up, she went home and discovered her adoption certificate. Freddy attempted to sway her to help him do his bidding. She proved that a thirst for murder was not hereditary, and schemed with Doc to destroy Krueger once and for all. After pulling him out of her dream, a small scuffle between father and daughter occurred, which resulted in Maggie shoving a pipe bomb into Krueger's chest, before running away. After she killed him and released the Dream Demons that had given him his power, Krueger was sent back to Hell. Afterwards, she smiled and replied to Doc and Tracy, Freddy's dead.

He eventually makes the cut as an extra for Satan's Alley (billed as a musical trip through Hell) and immediately sets his sights on the show's snooty prima-donna star (Finola Hughes, decidedly unsuited for such dancing as her role requires).

His regiment also manned the boats when Washington crossed the Delaware river to attack the British army at Trenton, N.J. He was present at the battle of Stillwater; shared with Washington the hardships of Valley Forge; was appointed brigadier-general, Feb. 21, 1777; served under Schuyler at Saratoga, and conducted the army of Burgoyne as prisoners of war across the country to Cambridge, Mass. He was with General Greene's division in New Jersey in 1778; was in Rhode Island under Sullivan in 1779; was superintendent of drafts in Massachusetts in 1780; and a member of the Andr\u00e9 court of inquiry at Tappan, N.Y,, Sept. 29, 1780. William P. Upham of Salem, Mass., prepared an interesting memoir of him, published in 1863. He died in Marblehead, Mass., Jan. 30, 1797. from The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans: Volume IV #R##N##R##N#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glover_(general)#R##N##R##N#John Glover (November 5, 1732 \u2013 January 30, 1797) was an American fisherman, merchant, and military leader from Marblehead, Massachusetts, who served as a Brigadier General in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.#R##N##R##N#Early life #R##N##R##N#Glover was born in Salem, Massachusetts, the son of a house carpenter. His father died when he was four years old, and shortly thereafter his family moved to the nearby town of Marblehead. As a young man, Glover became a cordwainer and rum trader and eventually a ship owner and merchant. He married Hannah Gale in October 1754.#R##N##R##N#Following the Boston Massacre in 1770, Committees of Correspondence were formed. Marblehead elected Glover along with future revolutionists Elbridge Gerry and Azore Orne to committee posts. After the First Continental Congress passed the non-importation agreements sanctioning trade with the British, Glover was elected to enforce the embargo as a member of the committee of inspection.#R##N##R##N#Military career #R##N##R##N#Glover was active in the militia for many years before the Revolution, with his earliest service dating back to 1759. In 1775 he was elected lieutenant colonel of the 21st Massachusetts Regiment from Marblehead, and became commander of the unit after the death of Colonel Jeremiah Lee in April 1775. Glover marched his regiment to join the siege of Boston in June 1775. At Boston, General George Washington chartered Glover's schooner Hannah to raid British supply vessels, the first of many privateers authorized by Washington. For this reason the Hannah has been called the first vessel of the United States Navy.#R##N##R##N#The Marblehead militia or Glover's Regiment became the 14th Continental Regiment. This regiment became known as the amphibious regiment for their vital nautical skills. After Washington lost the Battle of Long Island in August 1776, Glover's Marbleheaders evacuated the army to Manhattan in a surprise nighttime operation, saving them from being entrapped. In subsequent actions of the New York campaign the regiment fought well against the British at Kip's Bay and Pell's Point. The last action of the regiment was its most famous: ferrying Washington's army across the Delaware River for a surprise attack at Trenton in December 1776. The regiment was disbanded as enlistments expired at year's end.#R##N##R##N#Glover went home to tend to his sick wife and look to business affairs. He turned down a promotion to brigadier general in February 1777, but rejoined the war after a personal appeal from General Washington. He served in the successful Saratoga campaign in 1777 and the failed Battle of Rhode Island in 1778. He was stationed along the Hudson River for the remainder of the war, guarding against British moves up the river from NYC.#R##N##R##N#Later life#R##N##R##N#Hannah, Glover's first wife, died in 1778. He married again in 1781 to Frances Fosdick. He retired from the army in 1782 in poor health. Failing to secure a job with the U.S. federal government, he served in various local offices in his remaining years. He died at age 64 in Marblehead, Massachusetts, after contracting hepatitis and was buried in Old Burial Hill (Marblehead, Massachusetts).#R##N##R##N#Memorials#R##N##R##N#Various things have been named in his honor. On November 20, 1783, he was awarded the charter for the town of Glover, Vermont, as its prime proprietor, in honor of his service. The frigate USS Glover is named for him. Glover's Rock in the Bronx is a memorial to him and Glover School in Marblehead was named after him in 1916. There is a statue of General John Glover on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston. The General John Glover House is located in Marblehead.#R##N##R##N#Burial: Marblehead, Essex County, Massachusetts, USA* Updated from Ancestry Genealogy via Abigail Burnham of Marblehead.

It is primarily used in assisted reproduction to control ovulation. The drug works by blocking the action of GnRH upon the pituitary, thus rapidly suppressing the production and action of LH and FSH. Ganirelix is used in fertility treatment to prevent premature ovulation that could result in the harvesting of eggs that are too immature to be used in procedures such as in vitro fertilisation. GnRH agonists are also sometimes used in reproductive therapy, as well as to treat disorders involving sex-steroid hormones, such as endometriosis. One advantage of using GnRH antagonists is that repeated administration of GnRH agonists results in decreased levels of gonadotropins and sex steroids due to desensitization of the pituitary. This is avoided when using GnRH antagonists such as Ganirelix. The success of Ganirelix in reproductive therapy has been shown to be comparable to that when using GnRH agonists.

Although this conjunction of   information and power provides great benefits to society, it also threatens individual privacy. As a result legislators for many countries try to regulate the use and the disclosure of  confidential information. Various privacy regulations (such as USA Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Canadian Standard Association\u2019s Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information, Australian Privacy Amendment Act, etc.) have been enacted in many countries all over the world. Data privacy and protecting individuals\u2019 anonymity have become  a mainstream avenue for research. While privacy is a topic discussed everywhere, data anonymity recently established itself as an emerging area of computer science. Its goal is to  produce useful computational solutions for releasing data, while providing scientific guarantees that the identities and other sensitive information of the individuals who are the subjects of the data are protected. The proposed workshop aims to provide an open yet focused platform for researchers and practitioners from computer science and other fields that are interacting with computer science in the privacy area such as statistics, healthcare informatics, and law to discuss and present current research challenges and advances in data privacy and anonymity research.

He came from a family involved with the visual arts: his older brother Joseph (1816\u20131892) and his son L\u00e9opold (1866\u20131935) were painters, while another brother Arthur (1825\u201399) was an art dealer and critic. His father, who had fought in the Napoleonic wars in the army of William I of the Netherlands, was an art collector who owned several watercolors by <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix>Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix</a>, among other artists. His mother's parents ran Caf\u00e9 de l'Amiti\u00e9 in Brussels, a meeting place for politicians, writers, and artists. All the Stevens children benefited from the people they met there, and the social skills they acquired in growing up around important people. ; ;After the death of his father in 1837, Stevens left middle school to begin study at the <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/acad-mie-royale-des>Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts</a> in Brussels, where he knew Fran\u00e7ois Navez, the Neo-Classical painter and former student of <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david>Jacques-Louis David</a> who was its director and an old friend of Stevens's grandfather. Following a traditional curriculum, he drew from casts of classical sculpture for the first two years, and then drew from live models. In 1843, Stevens went to Paris, joining his brother Joseph who already was there. He was admitted to the <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/cole-des-beaux-arts>\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts</a>, the most important art school in Paris. Although it is said that he became a student of its director <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres>Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres</a>, this is likely not true. An early picture by Stevens, The Pardon or Absolution (Hermitage, St. Petersburg), signed and dated 1849, shows his mastery of a conventional naturalistic style which owes much to 17th-century Dutch genre painting. Like the Belgian painter and friend with whom he stayed in Paris, Florent Joseph Marie Willems (1823\u20131905), Stevens carefully studied works by painters such as <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerard-terborch>Gerard ter Borch</a> and <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gabriel-metsu>Gabriel Metsu</a>. ; ;Stevens's work was shown publicly for the first time in 1851, when three of his paintings were admitted to the Brussels Salon. He was awarded a third-class medal at the Paris Salon in 1853, and a second-class medal at the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1855. His Ce qu'on appelle le vagabondage [What is called vagrancy] (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris) attracted the attention of Napoleon III who, as a result of the scene in the picture, ordered that soldiers no longer be used to pick up the poor from the streets. Two other paintings he exhibited at the Salon in Antwerp that year, Chez soi or At Home (present location unknown) and The Painter and his Model (Walters Art Museum, Baltimore), introduced subjects from la vie moderne for which he became known: an elegant young woman in contemporary dress and the artist in his studio. In 1857, Stevens made his first important sale to a private collector, when Consolation was bought for a rumored 6,000 francs by the Berlin collector and dealer Rav\u00e9n\u00e9. At the same time, he and his brother were becoming part of the art world of Paris, meeting people such as the Goncourt brothers, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, and Alexandre Dumas at the salons of Princess Mathilde as well as popular caf\u00e9s. In 1858, Stevens married Marie Blanc, who came from a rich Belgian family and old friends of the Stevens's.

He was born John Harvey Johnson, Jr. in New Rockford, North Dakota, in 1917, the son of John Sr., a real estate man, and his wife Katherine. John Jr. began his career in radio as an announcer while his splendidly resonant voice eventually carried him into stage work. Relocating to the West Coast to pursue a film career, John sought attention first on the L.A. legitimate stage with productions of White Cargo and Getting Gertie's Garter. His lead in the former led to an arrest of him and his leading lady, Patricia Saunders, due to its offensive material and semi-nudity. The attention certainly didn't hurt him. Bro, but Broadway beckoned before any film/TV jobs came his way. He made his NY debut with Johnny 2 X 4 in 1942, followed by Kiss and Tell which was produced and directed by George Abbott the next year. By this time he had met and fallen in love with actress Judy Parrish. In fact the two married each other just a few days before the March 17, 1943 opening of Kiss and Tell in which they co-starred together. The show was a hit and ran for two years. Their daughter, Johanna, was born in February of 1944. The dark-haired, genially handsome actor, having developed heartthrob status with his role of Private Earhart on Broadway, once again gave films a try. Signed by 20th Century-Fox, he was given romantic co-starring status in the war-era films with Kay Francis in Four Jills in a Jeep (1944) and Betty Grable in Pin Up Girl (1944). For some reason, he felt uncomfortable before the camera and, despite his amiable good looks, his discomfort showed and he came off stiff and bland. Unsatisfied with himself on film, he asked for the release of his contract after filming The Spider (1945). Returning to the first love, the stage, John and his wife enjoyed a strong run of the L.A. play Petticoat Fever before showing up again on Broadway in a brief run of Open House in 1947. They also gave on-camera work a try and appeared together on the West Coast in the early Dumont TV sitcom The Growing Paynes (1948) with John playing insurance salesman George Payne and Judith portraying his wife Laraine. They were eventually replaced before the series was canceled. John went on and attempted TV showcases as well, appearing in a number of live dramas including The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre, NBC Presents, Kraft Theatre, Robert Montgomery Presents. By the early 1950s John had tired of his acting career and instead, along with his wife, opened up his own talent agency, United Talent, Inc. back in New York City. He also focused on union activity of SAG and AFTRA. He was elected to the national board of TvA (Television Authority), serving as its chairman, and in the 1960s became treasurer of Theatrical Artist Representatives, a group of agents affiliated with Actors Equity.John continued to work in New York City and died suddenly of a heart attack on Christmas Day in 1970.", "label": "0", "context": "John Harvey contributed to which literary series?"}

The estimation of this angle, the altitude, is known as sighting or shooting the object, or taking a sight. The angle, and the time when it was measured, can be used to calculate a position line on a nautical or aeronautical chart\u2014for example, sighting the Sun at noon or Polaris at night (in the Northern Hemisphere) to estimate latitude. Sighting the height of a landmark can give a measure of distance off and, held horizontally, a sextant can measure angles between objects for a position on a chart. A sextant can also be used to measure the lunar distance between the moon and another celestial object (such as a star or planet) in order to determine Greenwich Mean Time and hence longitude. The principle of the instrument was first implemented around 1731 by John Hadley (1682\u20131744) and Thomas Godfrey (1704\u20131749), but it was also found later in the unpublished writings of Isaac Newton (1643\u20131727). Additional links can be found to Bartholomew Gosnold (1571\u20131607) indicating that the use of a sextant for nautical navigation predates Hadley's implementation.

In further contrast, the role of Rodrigo, of subsidiary importance in Shakespeare and Verdi, is very prominent in Rossini's version and is assigned some of the most difficult and brilliant music. The roles of Otello, Iago, and Rodrigo are all composed for the tenor voice. Rossini's Otello is an important milestone in the development of opera as musical drama.

He wrote it during 1870-71 and published in 1872, as a prequel to his first book The Innocents Abroad (1869). This book tells of Twain's adventures prior to his pleasure cruise related in Innocents Abroad.  Roughing It follows the travels of young Mark Twain through the Wild West during the years 1861-1867. After a brief stint as a Confederate cavalry militiaman (not included in the account), he joined his brother Orion Clemens, who had been appointed Secretary of the Nevada Territory, on a stagecoach journey west. Twain consulted his brother's diary to refresh his memory and borrowed heavily from his active imagination for many stories in the book.  Roughing It illustrates many of Twain's early adventures, including a visit to Salt Lake City, gold and silver prospecting, real-estate speculation, a journey to the Kingdom of Hawaii, and his beginnings as a writer. This memoir provides examples of Twain's rough-hewn humor, which would become a staple of his writing in such later books as Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), The Adventures of Tom Sawyer(1876), and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889).  Titbits:   U.S. astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell read Roughing It aloud to pass the time aboard NASA's Gemini VII, a 14-day-long Earth orbital mission in December 1965. Borman recalls reading the book during an on-camera interview in the PBS-TV (USA) television program Nova: To the Moon (1999).  Some Quotes From the Classic:  -The air up there in the clouds is very pure and fine, bracing and delicious. And why shouldn't it be?--it is the same the angels breathe.-  -Wherever he found his speech growing too modern -- which was about every sentence or two -- he ladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as -exceeding sore, - -and it came to pass, - etc., and made things satisfactory again. -And it came to pass- was his pet. If he had left that out, his Bible would have been only a pamphlet.-  -The first glance at the pillow showed me a repulsive sentinel perched upon each end of it--cockroaches as large as peach leaves--fellows with long, quivering antennae and fiery, malignant eyes. They were grating their teeth like tobacco worms, and appeared to be dissatisfied about something. I had often heard that these reptiles were in the habit of eating off sleeping sailors' toe nails down to the quick, and I would not get in the bunk any more. I lay down on the floor. But a rat came and bothered me, and shortly afterward a procession of cockroaches arrived and camped in my hair. In a few moments the rooster was crowing with uncommon spirit and a party of fleas were throwing double somersaults about my person in the wildest disorder, and taking a bite every time they stuck. I was beginning to feel really annoyed. I got up and put my clothes on and went on deck. The above is not overdrawn; it is a truthful sketch of inter-island schooner life.-  -This book is merely a personal narrative, and not a pretentious history or a philosophical dissertation. It is a record of several years of variegated vagabondizing, and it's object is rather to help the resting reader while away an idle hour than afflict him with metaphysics, or goad him with science.-  Scroll Up and Grab Your Copy", "entity1": "Roughing it <S> book.edition media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work ratings.rated_entity <S> Based on Mark Twain's own years of variegated vagabonding in the West, this comic narrative offers a virtual grab-bag of tall tales, folklore, beast fables, travelogue, local color, autobiography, history, geography--even statistics. This new critical edition of Roughing Itsupersedes the 1972 edition published in the Works of Mark Twain over twenty years ago. It is an entirely new undertaking, by a different group of editors. Together they have made extensive use of newly discovered historical and textual materials, particularly biographical documents which illuminate how Mark Twain gave literary shape to his actual experiences in the West. This edition includes the more than 300 illustrations Mark Twain commissioned for his book. It also provides six new maps: two for Nevada in the 1860s and four to help trace the Clemens brothers' cross-country stagecoach route. The editors provide a comprehensive introduction that will supplant all previous accounts of how Mark Twain wrote and revised his second long book. Fully supplemented by the textual apparatus, the edition presents a complete record of Twain's revisions and is sure to become the standard text of Mark Twain's great Western adventure.

A former Nieman Fellow in Journalism at Harvard University, Kirk was the senior producer of Frontline from the series' inception in 1983 until the fall of 1987, when he created his own production company, Kirk Documentary Group, based in Boston, Massachusetts. Kirk has won every major award in broadcast journalism, including four Peabody Awards, three duPont-Columbia Awards, fifteen Emmy Awards, two George Polk Awards, and eleven Writers Guild of America Awards. Kirk born in Denver, Colorado later moved to Boise, Idaho where he grew up and attended Bishop Kelly High School. He graduated from the University of Idaho in 1971 with a degree in communications. The university named an award after Kirk, The Michael Kirk Award, given annually to a student in broadcast journalism; In 2000 he was named to the University of Idaho Hall of Fame; and in 2013 Michael was bestowed an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters by the University of Idaho. Kirk is currently producing and directing a two-hour special examining Russian President Vladimir Putin, exploring his rise, rule and motivations (broadcasting October 25 and November 1 on FRONTLINE). Earlier this year, Kirk produced and directed Bannon's War, the inside story of Trump adviser Stephen Bannon's war -- with radical Islam, Washington and White House rivals; Trump's Road to the White House, the inside story of how Donald Trump won the presidency, told by seven of Trump's top campaign aides and the highest-ranking Clinton advisors; and the four-hour miniseries, Divided States of America - the epic chronicle of the eight years of Barack Obama's presidency woven against the backdrop of dramatic changes confronting the GOP, including the rise of Donald Trump. In 2016, FRONTLINE aired three of Kirk's films-- the two-hour election special The Choice 2016, (Writers Guild Award) the personal narrative and political history of presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump; The Secret History of ISIS, the story of the many missed warning signs and the U.S. failures to stop the group's brutal growth; and Netanyahu at War, an inside look at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political rise and his contentious relationship with Barack Obama. In 2015, Kirk produced Secrets, Politics and Torture, the secret history of the CIA's controversial enhanced interrogation methods, and Gunned Down: The Power of the NRA (Emmy Award), an investigation into the NRA, its political evolution and influence, and how it has consistently succeeded in defeating new gun control legislation. Other productions include: Losing Iraq, a 90-minute film tracing the U.S. role in the Iraq war from the 2003 invasion to the violent rise of the radical jihadist group ISIS; United States of Secrets: The Program (duPont-Columbia Award, Peabody Award, two Emmy Awards -- including Best Documentary, Writers Guild Award), the dramatic inside story of how the U.S. government came to monitor and collect the communications of millions of people around the world -- including ordinary Americans -- and the lengths they went to trying to hide the massive surveillance program from the public; League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis (Peabody Award, George Polk Award, Writers Guild Award), a two-hour investigation revealing how, for years, the NFL worked to refute scientific evidence that the violent collisions at the heart of the game are linked to alarming incidences of early-onset dementia; Cliffhanger, a look into the nation's fiscal crises and the inside history of how Washington has failed to solve the country's problems of debt and deficit; The Choice 2012 (Writers Guild Award), the quadrennial FRONTLINE special that examines the political and personal biographies of presidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney (he also produced the special in 2008, which featured Barack Obama and John McCain, and the 2000 version on George W. Bush and Al Gore); Money, Power and Wall Street (Emmy Award, George Polk Award), the four-hour series that tells the inside story of the financial crisis; Top Secret America (Writers Guild Award), a yearlong examination into the huge, unwieldy, top-secret world the government has created since 9/11; The Anthrax Files, a reinvestigation into the anthrax case a decade after the attacks; and Obama's Deal, a look at the push to reform health care. Prior to Money, Power and Wall Street, he produced three other investigations of the 2008 financial crisis: the Emmy Award-winning The Warning, the unique story of a regulator's warning about the dangers of derivatives in the 1990s; Breaking the Bank, an inside look into the complicated financial and political web threatening Bank of America; and Inside the Meltdown, a major investigation into the collapse of the American economy. In the spring of 2008 he produced, directed and wrote the four-and-a-half-hour, two-part special Bush's War, which won an Emmy and a Writers Guild Award. He has produced ten films on the war on terror, including Cheney's Law (Peabody Award); Endgame; The Lost Year in Iraq (Emmy Award); Rumsfeld's War; The Torture Question (Emmy Award, Writers Guild Award); The Dark Side (Writers Guild Award); The War Behind Closed Doors, an analysis of the political infighting that led to the war with Iraq; and The Man Who Knew, the extraordinary saga of FBI Agent John O'Neill. During Kirk's long relationship with FRONTLINE, he also made the Peabody Award-winning Waco - The Inside Story (1995), a behind-the-scenes look at the FBI siege of the Branch Davidian compound; and the Emmy Award-winning The Kevorkian File (1994), an in-depth examination of Dr. Jack Kevorkian's controversial record and cases.

Cobalt-based blue pigments have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists to be due to the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal, and this was ultimately named for the kobold.

As with most philosophically-driven disciplines, the concept of justice differs in every culture. An early theory of justice was set out by the Ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his work The Republic. Advocates of divine command theory say that justice issues from God. In the 17th century, theorists like John Locke advocated natural rights as a derivative of justice. Thinkers in the social contract tradition state that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned. In the 19th century, utilitarian thinkers including John Stuart Mill said that justice is what has the best consequences. Theories of distributive justice concern what is distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the proper distribution. Egalitarians state that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. John Rawls used a theory of social contract to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Property rights theorists (like Robert Nozick) take a deontological view of distributive justice and state that property rights-based justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice are concerned with punishment for wrongdoing. Restorative justice (also sometimes called reparative justice) is an approach to justice that focuses on restoring what is good, and necessarily focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.", "entity1": "Justice <S> ratings.rated_entity event.agent media_common.cataloged_instance music.artist music.group <S> Justice is a thrash metal band from D\u00fcrrbrunn, Germany, formed in 1989 by Ian Finlay (drums), Wolfgang Ott (bass) and Uli Friedel (guitar).

But when he dreams of crashing his airplane in a remote corner of the world, all he can think of is the whereabouts of his journalist girlfriend, Vivianne Keene. He awakens at a small airstrip in rural America, a year backward in time, suffering from apparent heatstroke and random amnesia. Brought to his knees, he is rescued by a World War II Spitfire pilot and poet, John Gillespie Magee, Jr., and makes a shocking discovery.  Mere flesh and bone could barely contain John Magee's lifeforce as he grew into a young man. A self-made intellectual as a teenager, he didn't expect to live past his twenties. When stranded in America at the onset of Britain's war with Germany, he was hellbent on returning to England and his love, novelist Elinor Lyon. At age 19 he finally went back as a pilot officer with the Canadian Royal Air Force. Exuberant with newfound freedom and powered by a Supermarine Spitfire, he trod the untrespassed sanctity of space ... and touched the face of God, thus birthing his sonnet, High Flight, the aviator's anthem for more than 75 years. Blending history with fiction, John Magee's own words on love and death in A Day in Eternity resonate for all time.  The poetry of  John Magee] is magically woven into the story. ...The transcendence of time and place, and the building of the characters as they grow, ascend, and fly through the rising action, is stimulating. - Cheryl E.

The existence of multiple elements in their salts was suspected in 1702, and this was proven in 1807 when potassium and sodium were individually isolated from different salts by electrolysis.
