The group mainly consisted of Stephen Malkmus (vocals and guitar), Scott Kannberg (guitar and vocals), Mark Ibold (bass), Steve West (drums) and Bob Nastanovich (percussion and vocals). Initially conceived as a recording project, the band at first avoided press or live performances, while attracting considerable underground attention with their early releases. Gradually evolving into a more polished band, Pavement recorded five full-length albums and nine EPs over the course of their decade-long career, though they disbanded with some acrimony in 1999 as the members moved on to other projects. In 2010, they undertook a well-received reunion tour. Though only briefly brushing the mainstream with the single Cut Your Hair in 1994, Pavement was a successful indie rock band. Rather than signing with a major label as many of their 1980s forebears had done, they remained signed to independent labels throughout their career and have often been described as one of the most influential bands to emerge from the American underground in the '90s.

The earliest date is probably in error, as it was several years prior to his parents marriage. #R##N##R##N#Sir Thomas' mother Alice was the sister and heiress of Sir Edmund FitzHerbert.

She was the widow of Ralph De Wilington of Sandhurst, Gloucestershire, who died on 16 Aug. 1382. When her brother John died without issue, Joan became heiress to her younger half-brother, Thomas.

River access assisted heavy industrial development such as that of the Studebaker Corporation, the Oliver Chilled Plow Company, and other large corporations. The population of South Bend has declined since a peak of 132,445 in 1960, chiefly due to migration to suburban areas as well as the demise of Studebaker and other heavy industry.

She appeared in the musical State Fair (1962) a year later before her breakthrough in 1963. With Bye Bye Birdie (1963) and Viva Las Vegas (1964) opposite Elvis Presley, she became a Top 10 Box Office star, teen idol and even Golden Globe nominated actress. She was marketed as Hollywood's hottest young star and in the years to come got awarded the infamous nickname sex kitten. Her following pictures were sometimes ripped apart by critics (Bus Riley's Back in Town (1965) and The Swinger (1966)), sometimes praised (The Cincinnati Kid (1965)). She couldn't escape being typecast because of her great looks. By the late 1960s, her career stalled, and she turned to Italy for new projects. She returned and, by 1970, she was back in the public image with Hollywood films (R.P.M. (1970) opposite Anthony Quinn), Las Vegas sing-and-dance shows and her own television specials. She finally overcame her image with her Oscar-nominated turn in Mike Nichols' Carnal Knowledge (1971) and succeeded in changing her image from sex kitten to respected actress. A near-fatal accident at a Lake Tahoe show in 1972 only momentarily stopped her career. She was again Oscar-nominated in 1975 for Tommy (1975), the rock opera film of the British rock band The Who. Her career continued with successful films throughout the late 1970s and into the 1980s. She starred next to Anthony Hopkins in Magic (1978) and appeared in pictures co-starring Walter Matthau, Gene Hackman, Glenda Jackson and Roy Scheider. She even appeared in a television remake of Tennessee Williams's masterpiece play A Streetcar Named Desire in 1983. Another late career highlight for her was Grumpy Old Men (1993) as the object of desire for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. She continues to act in movies today.", "user_response_answer": "0", "entity2": "Molly Ringwald <S> media_common.cataloged_instance award.competitor award.nominee award.winner biology.organism book.author event.agent film.actor tv.personality tv.crewmember tv.actor theater.actor ratings.rated_entity people.person music.musician music.artist <S> Molly Ringwald Net Worth: Molly Ringwald is an American actress who has a net worth of $11 million.

He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as Blowin' in the Wind and The Times They Are a-Changin' became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single Like a Rolling Stone, recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. Dylan's mid-1960s recordings, backed by rock musicians, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.#R##N##R##N#wikipedia Talk:Bob Dylan/Archive 8 - ... His Turkish ethnicity#R##N##R##N#... This quote comes from Bob Dylan's very own book in 'Chronicles: Volume One'. He says the following: My grandmother's ancestors had been from Constantinople. As a teenager, I used to sing the Ritchie Valens song 'In a Turkish Town' with the lines in it about the 'mystery Turks and the stars above,' and it seemed to suit me more than 'La Bamba.' (pg. 93). You can also find this quote cited in many articles see for example [36] (page 28) and [37] \u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.145.8.128 (talk) 11:28, 12 December 2010 (UTC)#R##N##R##N#Recently I found out this, Dylan\u2019s mother was born Beatrice R. Stone in 1915, and had an older brother, Vernon. Two younger siblings followed, Lewis and Irene. All born in the US, they were the children of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants Benjamin David Solemovitz (born 1883), who changed Solemovitz to Stone, and his wife Florence Sara nee Edelstein, herself one of ten children.#R##N##R##N#Taking Florence Sara first: the Florence who would become Bob Dylan\u2019s grandmother\u2014she and the other nine Edelstein children were in turn the sons and daughters of Benjamin Harold Edelstein (born 1870) and Lybba nee Jaffe, from Kovno (Kaunas) in Lithuania. (Benjamin Harold\u2019s parents were David and Ida Edelstein; Ida\u2019s parents were Yehuda Aron and Rachel ne\u00b4e Berkovitz. Lybba Jaffe\u2019s parents were Aaron Jaffe and Fannie.)

She joined her husband Zigman Zimmerman, emigrating from Odessa (on the Black Sea, in present-day Ukraine) to the US by 1910. The sentence in the article acknowledges Dylan's version in Chronicles: In his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kyrgyz and her family originated from Istanbul.#R##N##R##N#One problem is that the information on Anna's death certificate contradicts Dylan's version. The death certificate was signed by her oldest son Maurice (Bob Dylan's uncle), and it states that she was born in Odessa. This is how Michael Gray summarizes it in The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, pp 729-730, under the heading Zimmerman family:#R##N##R##N#Anna, who had also moved to Hibbing, and lived for some years with Bob\u2019s Uncle Maurice, moved into a nursing home way down in St. Paul and died there of arteriosclerosis on April 20, 1955. Her death certificate, with the information supplied by Uncle Maurice, confirmed that she\u2019d been born in Odessa. Dylan contradicts this, writing in Chronicles: Volume One of visiting her when she still lived in Duluth: she \u2018had only one leg and had been a seamstress. \u2026 She\u2019d come to America from Odessa.[but] Originally she\u2019d come from Turkey, sailed from Trabzon, a port town, across the Black Sea. . . .

Andrea Bocelli, one of the greatest singing talents in the world today, had poor eyesight since birth and went blind at the age of 12 following a football accident. Andrea started his singing career in the late 1980s, when he became a piano-bar performer throughout Italy. However, he became known to the wider audience after he won the Newcomers section of the Sanremo Music Festival in 1994. Since then, Bocelli has recorded 14 solo studio albums, of both pop and classical music, 3 greatest hits albums, as well as 9 complete operas, selling over 80 million records worldwide. However, it was his participation in Pavarotti's 1992 hit Miserere and Fornaciari's 1993 world tour helped propel him to international attention. Thus, he eventually turned into the most-selling artist in the history of classical music and established himself as one of the most exciting voices in contemporary opera during the late 20th century. He was honored with numerous awards and recognitions for his work, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He is also a great philanthropist and he has participated in charity concerts, such as the Michael Jackson benefit concert in 1998, the Memorial Concert at Ground Zero, in New York City for the victims of the September 11 attacks, and the Music of Asia festival in 2004, for the Indian tsunami appeal.

His legend continued to grow even after poor health and diminished creativity removed him from jazz royalty. Early life Miles Dewey Davis III was born to Miles Davis Jr. and Cleota Henry in Alton, Illinois, on May 25, 1926. There were also two other children, an older sister and a younger brother. In 1928 the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois, where Davis's father became a successful oral surgeon. Davis enjoyed a comfortable childhood and the family lived in a white neighborhood. At the age of thirteen his father gave him a trumpet and soon Davis joined his high school band. While still in high school he met and was coached by his earliest idol, the great St. Louis trumpeter Clark Terry (1920\u2013). After fathering two children by a woman friend, Davis moved to New York City in 1944. He worked for just two weeks in the talent-packed Billy Eckstine Band, then enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music. By day he studied classical music, and by night he gained experience in jazz's newest movement, bebop, with the leaders of the movement, notably Charlie Parker (1920\u20131955), Dizzy Gillespie (1917\u20131993), Fats Navarro, and Max Roach (1924\u2013).  Cool jazz Davis's stint from 1947 to 1948 in a quintet (group of five musicians) led by bebop genius Charlie Parker brought him early fame. A fine bebop trumpeter, Davis soon felt a need to rid his music of bebop's style and to restore jazz's more melodic elements. The result was the influential recording Birth of the Cool (1949), which gave birth to the so-called cool, or West Coast, jazz school. This recording established Davis' musical identity, separate from Parker and the other beboppers. In the early 1950s Davis became a heroin (dangerous drug made from morphine) addict. His career came to a near halt for three years, but his ultimately successful fight against the drug habit in 1954 led to his greatest period: the mid-to-late 1950s. During that six-year span he made a series of small group recordings regarded as jazz classics. In 1954, with tenor saxophone titan Sonny Rollins (1930\u2013), he made memorable recordings of three Rollins originals\u2014Airegin, Doxy, and Oleo\u2014as well as two brilliant versions of the Tin Pan Alley (a respected group of musicians and songwriters) standard But Not for Me. In 1955 Davis formed his most celebrated group, a remarkably talented quintet that featured tenor saxophonist John Coltrane (1926\u20131967), pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones. Until Coltrane left in the 1960s, Davis's band was the single most visible and dominant group in all of jazz. In 1964 he put together a new band, and Davis continued to be the greatest attraction (and biggest money-maker) in all of jazz. His new band, however, could not match the impossibly high standards of the original band. Davis, the person For the last two decades of Davis's career he became more of a jazz curiosity than a musician to be taken seriously. A good part of his fame owed less to his considerable musicianship than to his strange personality. Davis gained a poor reputation in performance for turning his back on audiences, for expressing racial hostility toward whites, for dressing poorly early in his career and wildly later\u2014all of which contributed to his mysterious image. Davis was a complex man with strengths and weaknesses that would ultimately destroy him. Himself the victim of a policeman's clubbing (reportedly, racially inspired), he had the fairness and courage in the late 1950s to challenge black jazzmen's expectations by filling a piano vacancy with a white player, Bill Evans (1929\u20131980); but then, by all accounts, Davis often racially taunted him. A physical fitness enthusiast (with his own private gym), he nevertheless took vast amounts of drugs (sometimes, but not always, for pain). Oftentimes unfriendly, he was also capable of acts of generosity toward struggling musicians, both black and white. Davis was married three times\u2014to dancer Frances Taylor, singer Betty Mabry, and actress Cicely Tyson. All three marriages ended in divorce. He had, in all, three sons, a daughter, and seven grandchildren. He died on September 28, 1991, in Santa Monica, California, of pneumonia, respiratory failure, and a stroke. Davis remains one of the most influential musicians in the history of jazz. His music lives on in recordings like Miles Ahead (1957), Porgy and Bess (1958), and Sketches of Spain (1960), and the hauntingly blue sound of his trumpet.", "user_response_answer": "1", "entity2": "Sacred System <S> award.competitor award.nominee biology.organism broadcast.artist event.agent film.actor film.music_contributor media_common.cataloged_instance music.artist music.composer music.engineer music.lyricist music.musician music.producer people.person ratings.rated_entity tv.actor tv.personality <S> Bill Laswell is an American bassist, producer and record label owner. Laswell ranks among the most prolific of modern musicians, being involved in hundreds of recordings with many collaborators from all over the world. Laswell's music draws upon many different genres, most notably funk, various world music, jazz, dub and ambient styles. He has also played or produced music from the noisier, more aggressive end of the rock spectrum, such as hardcore punk and metal. According to music critic Chris Brazier, Laswell's pet concept is 'collision music' which involves bringing together musicians from wildly divergent but complementary spheres and seeing what comes out. The credo of one record label run by Laswell, and which typifies much of his work, is Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted. Though projects arranged by Laswell may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically: Material began as a noisy dance music project, but subsequent releases have been centered on hip hop, jazz, or backing spoken word readings by beat generation icon William S. Burroughs."}

He was a self made man in every sense of the term. Intellectually he was a genius, being an expert mathemetician. He was a civil engineer by profession, a hospitable Christian gentleman in his home, and a man of charming manner to all who came in contact with him. He was of unusual vitality, both physically and mentally for one of his advanced age, having celebrated his eightieth birthday in March. The evening prior to his death he ate supper and was in his usual happy frame of mind and apparently in good health as he had been for some time and fell asleep. At 2:30 Friday morning he was found dead. Mr. Eaddy was born and reared and spent his long life in the vicinity of Johnsonville. In his young life he married Miss Eliza Louisa Ann Elizabeth Huggins of Timmonsville, a daughter of the late Rev. J.S. Huggins, inventor of the first cotton planter used in the south. He had represented the county of Williamsburg in the State Legislature several terms. He was first elected in 1890. He was one of the original founders of the Old Johnsonville Methodist Church and Trinity Methodist Church in Florence County and supervised the construction of the Old Johnsonville Church. During all of his public life he strove to render his county efficient service. Mr. Eaddy leaves a widow, the former Eliza Huggins, five sons and two daughters: Messrs. J.A. of Bushnell, Fla.; C. L. of Linden, Fla.; John M. of Kingstree; S.O. of Johnsonville; Dr. A. G. of Timmonsville; Mrs. W. A. Hanna of Gifford; and Mrs. R.B. Dickson of Johnsonville. The funeral service, conducted by Rev. E.P. Hutton, took place in Old Johnsonville Methodist Church at 4 p.m. Saturday, and internment was made in the church burying grounds. Six of his grandchildren acted as pallbearers.

Mick Fleetwood's net worth would be much higher but he has openly admitted to spending tens of millions of dollars on drugs and partying during his heyday. He was even forced to declare bankruptcy in 1984 after many years of hard partying and fast living. Michael John Kells Mick Fleetwood was born June 24, 1947 in Redruth, Cornwall, England, U.K. He is widely known as the drummer and co-founder of the rock band Fleetwood Mac. The band name was formulated by merging Mick's last name with part of John McVie's last name. After several album releases and lineup changes, including the addition of keyboardist Christine McVie (who also just so happened to be John McVie's wife), the group moved to the United States in 1974, where Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks soon joined Fleetwood Mac. Buckingham and Nicks contributed to much of Fleetwood Mac's later commercial success. Mick also enjoyed a solo career, published written works and flirted briefly with acting and winemaking. After the supporting tour for 1979's Tusk, Mick recorded his debut solo album, The Visitor, which was released in 1981 and showed off the drummer's interest in worldbeat. After the 1982 Mac album Mirage, he cut a second solo record, 1983's I'm Not Me, which featured cameos from several Mac members. Fleetwood Mac then went on hiatus until 1987, when Mick's declaration of bankruptcy prompted the reunion LP Tango in the Night; even Lindsey Buckingham was persuaded to join in, albeit only in the studio. The band's classic '70s lineup was splintered, but Mick Fleetwood kept versions of the band going throughout the '90s. Meanwhile, he continued working on outside projects, including starting his own record label, TallMan Records. As Fleetwood Mac prepared to tour again in early 2009, the drummer issued yet another album, this one culled from a live performance by the Mick Fleetwood Blues Band entitled Blue Again! with former Fleetwood Mac vocalist Rick Vito assuming front man duties.

Buckingham started playing music on a toy Mickey Mouse guitar before teaching himself how to play without knowing how to read music. His parents eventually bought him a $35 guitar and his real passion soon began to bloom. Lindsey started singing professionally with his girlfriend at the time, Stevie Nicks. In 1972 the produced several demos and within a year signed a record deal with Polydor Records. They were dropped from the label after their first album Buckingham and Nicks performed poorly. One day, the duo was discovered accidentally by musician Mick Fleetwood at Sound City recording studio. They eventually formed Fleetwood Mac which has sold more than 100 million albums worldwide to date. Lindsey stayed with the band from 1975 to 1987. He then rejoined the band in 1997 and has been with the group ever since. Outside of Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey has released nine solo albums and three DVDs and several live compilation albums of his performances. Lindsey has three children with his wife Kristen Messner.

Weyl published technical and some general works on space, time, matter, philosophy, logic, symmetry and the history of mathematics. He was one of the first to conceive of combining general relativity with the laws of electromagnetism. While no mathematician of his generation aspired to the 'universalism' of Henri Poincar\u00e9 or Hilbert, Weyl came as close as anyone.

Laswell's music draws upon many different genres, most notably funk, various world music, jazz, dub and ambient styles. He has also played or produced music from the noisier, more aggressive end of the rock spectrum, such as hardcore punk and metal. According to music critic Chris Brazier, Laswell's pet concept is 'collision music' which involves bringing together musicians from wildly divergent but complementary spheres and seeing what comes out. The credo of one record label run by Laswell, and which typifies much of his work, is Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted. Though projects arranged by Laswell may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically: Material began as a noisy dance music project, but subsequent releases have been centered on hip hop, jazz, or backing spoken word readings by beat generation icon William S.

He stands at the head of the clan of Reginarids, an important Lotharingian noble family and was the grandson of the emperor Lothair I.#R##N##R##N#He was the son of Gilbert, Count of the Maasgau, and a daughter of Lothair I of whom the name is not known (Hiltrude, Bertha, Irmgard, and Gisela are good candidates).#R##N##R##N#He succeeded his father in the Maasgau and was the lay abbot of Echternach between 897 and 915, of Maastricht from before May 898, and of Stablo and Malmedy between 900 and 902.#R##N##R##N#He was the Count of Mons and Count of Li\u00e8ge when in 870 he and Franco, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge, led an army against the Vikings in Walacria. He, as Duke of Hesbaye and Hainault, and Radbold led a Frisian army against the forces of Rollo a little later, but were forced back to his fortresses.#R##N##R##N#In the 877 Capitulary of Quierzy, he appears alongside his father as one of the regents of the kingdom during Charles the Bald's absence on campaign in Italy. A Reginar appears at the Siege of Paris in 886, but this may be an uncle or nephew. The name Reginar or Reginhar (French: R\u00e9gnier or Rainier) was commonplace in his family.#R##N##R##N#Reginar was originally a supporter of Zwentibold in 895, but he broke with the king in 898. He and some other magnates who had been key to Zwentibold's election three years earlier then took the opportunity provided by the death of Odo of West Francia to invite Charles the Simple to become king in Lotharingia. His lands were confiscated, but he refused to give them up and entrenched himself at Durfost, downstream from Maastricht. Representatives of Charles, Zwentibold, and the Emperor Arnulf met at Sankt Goar and determined that the succession should go to Louis the Child. Zwentibold was killed by Reginar in battle in August 900.#R##N##R##N#At first, Louis appeared to be opposed to Reginar when he appointed Gebhard as his deputy in Lotharingia, but the two were never at war. In 908, Reginar recuperated the Hainault after the death of Sigard. Then, after the death of Gebhard in 910, in battle with the Magyars, Reginar appears as his successor. He led the magnates in opposing Conrad I of Germany and electing Charles the Simple their king. He was given the title marchio by Charles in 915. He never appears as the Duke of Lorraine, but he was definitely the military commander of the region under Charles. He himself was succeeded by his son Gilbert; however, the Reginarids did not succeed in establishing their supremacy in Lotharingia like the Liudolfings or Liutpoldings did in the duchies of Saxony and Bavaria.#R##N##R##N#Family[edit]#R##N##R##N#By his wife Hersinda (or Alberada), who predeceased him, Reginar left the following children: Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine Reginar II, Count of Hainaut Balderic, Bishop of Utrecht Frederick, Archbishop of Mainz a daughter, who married Berengar, Count of Namur#R##N##R##N#Balderic of Utrecht, Bishop of Utrecht, listed as child of Reginar and Hersinda above, is attached to the biography which claims that he was a cousin of Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine, and the son of different parents.#R##N##R##N#Sources[edit] Reuter, Timothy.

The primary source which confirms his parentage has not yet been identified. The Annales Hanoni\u00e6 name Manicherius filius [Albonis] (in a later passage clarified to be Manicerius Registensis dominus) as pater aut avunculus primi Ragineri and Raginerus dictus Longi-colli filius eius[6], which, as explained in the Introduction, must be incorrect. The Annales Hanoni\u00e6 name Rignerius Montensis comes as the ally of Francone episcopo Leodiensi against the Vikings in 870, and in a later undated passage Raginerus fighting cum Frissonibus in Walacria contra Rollonem[7], although it is unclear from the context whether these references are to Raginerus dictus Longi-colli. Guillaume de Jumi\u00e8ges describes how Rainier au long cou duc de Hasbaigne et du Hainaut et Radbold prince de Frise fought the Viking Rollo but were forced back to their castles[8]. The date when Reginar was installed as Comte de Hainaut is uncertain but was probably during the last quarter of the 9th century. An agreement dated 14 Jun 877 of Emperor Charles II le Chauve, presumably written with his own death in mind, names Arnulfus comes, Gislebertus, Letardus, Matfridus, Widricus, Gotbertus, Adalbertus, Ingelgerus, Rainerus as those willing to support the emperor's son if he travels across the Meuse[9], although it is curious that Giselbertus\u2026Rainerus should both be included if one was the father of the other. Ragenarius comes\u2026et coniuge mea Hersenda confirmed the donation of revenue from Sathanacense atque Mousense to Saint-Dagobert de Stenay made by Carolus\u2026Augustus Imperiali by charter dated to after 886[10]. The Annales Vedastini name Balduinus\u2026comes et Rodulfus frater eius necnon et Ragnerus when recording that they joined Zwentibold of Lotharingia in 895[11]. The Breve Chronicon Epternacense names \u201cReinerus\u201d as abbot of Echternach from 897 to 915[12]. Regino records that in 898 Zwentibold King of Lotharingia banished Reginarium ducem\u2026sibi fidissimum et unicum consiliarium who went with Odacro comite et quibusdam aliis, cum mulieribus et parvulis to Durfos (near Mosa fluvius) where they were besieged[13]. The passage appears to be the only indication that Reginar was granted the title duke. Reginar was presumably rehabilitated after King Zweintibold was murdered, as shown by the following charter. Ludwig IV das Kind King of Germany confirmed an exchange of property between Kloster Stablo and Reginarius comes by charter dated 10 Sep 902[14]. King Ludwig IV also confirmed an exchange of property involving Reganarius comes by charter dated 20 Oct 906[15], and a donation of property \u2026in pago ac in comitatu Hainuense to the church of Tongern at the request of Kepehardus et Reginharius comites by charter dated 18 Jan 908[16]. Raginarius comes and the abbot of Stavelot granted property in pago Hasbanio in locis Honavi, Versines et Serangio to quidam fidelium nostrorum Harduinus by charter dated 911, signed by Ragenarii comitis, Issaac comitis, Macineri comitis\u2026[17]. Reginar was installed as marchio by Charles III le Simple King of the West Franks in 915. Lay-abbot of St Servatius at Maastricht before May 898, and of Stablo and Malm\u00e9dy 900-902. Richer records the death of Ragenerus vir consularis et nobilis cognomento Collo-Longus at apud Marsnam palatium[18]. #R##N##R##N#m [firstly] HERSENDA, daughter of ---. Ragenarius comes\u2026et coniuge mea Hersenda confirmed the donation of revenue from Sathanacense atque Mousense to Saint-Dagobert de Stenay made by Carolus\u2026Augustus Imperiali by charter dated to after 886[19]. #R##N##R##N#m [secondly] ALBERADA, daughter of ---. Her marriage is confirmed by the charter dated 10 Feb 968 under which her daughter-in-law Gerberga\u2026Francorum regina donated alodo\u2026Marsnam in comitatu Masaugo to Reims Saint-R\u00e9my, confirmed by comitibus Emmone et Ansfrido, for the souls of senioris nostri pi\u00e6 memori\u00e6 Gisleberti suique\u2026patris\u2026et matris Rageneri et Albrad\u00e6[20]. The estimated birth date of her son Giselbert suggests that Alberada may have been her husband\u00b4s second wife, assuming that the charter which names his other wife Hersenda can be dated to soon after 886 (see above). Another possibility is that both documents refer to the same person, one or other having incorrectly represented her name. Maybe heiress of Hainaut[21]. Guillaume de Jumi\u00e8ges describes how the wife of Rainier au long cou returned captured prisoners to Rollo and paid him gold, silver and all the taxes of the duchy, but does not name her[22]. #R##N##R##N#Count Reginar [I] & his [second] wife had three children:#R##N##R##N#1.

Thegan's Vita Hludowici Imperatoris names (in order) Hlutharius, Pippinus, Hludowicus sons of Emperor Louis I & his wife Ermengard[8]. His father sent him to govern Bavaria in [Aug] 814[9]. He was crowned joint Emperor LOTHAIRE I in Jul 817 at Aachen, ruling jointly with his father. He was sent to Italy in 822, where he established his court at Pavia and was crowned King of Italy by the Archbishop of Milan. The Annales Xantenses record that Ludewicus imperator gave filio suo Lothario regnum Langobardorum in 822[10]. Einhard's Annales record that the emperor sent Walahum monachum propinquum suum [imperatoris] fratrem\u2026Adalhardi abbatis to Italy in 822 with Hlotharius\u2026filium suum[11]. He was again crowned Emperor, at Rome 5 Apr 823 by Pope Pascal I. The rivalry with his father and brothers was exacerbated by the unexpected birth of his half-brother Charles in 823. Tension was increased when Emperor Louis invested Charles with Alemannia, Rhetia, Alsace and part of Burgundy at Worms in Aug 829, reducing Lothaire's territory to Italy. Lothaire and his brothers rebelled in Mar 830, captured their father at Compi\u00e8gne, and forced him to revert to the constitutional arrangements decided in 817. However, Emperor Louis reasserted his authority at the assemblies of Nijmegen in Oct 830 and Aix-la-Chapelle in Feb 831, and deprived Lothaire of the imperial title and relegated him once more to Italy. A further revolt of the brothers followed. Emperor Louis was defeated and deposed by his sons at Compi\u00e8gne 1 Oct 833. He was exiled to the monastery of Saint-M\u00e9dard de Soissons. Lothaire declared himself sole emperor 30 Jun 833, but was forced to flee to Vienne by his brothers Pepin and Louis, who freed their father. Emperor Louis was restored 1 Mar 834, crowned once more at Metz 28 Feb 835. Lothaire captured Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, but was arrested by his father's troops near Chouzy. His father pardoned him and sent him back to Italy as king. Emperor Louis proposed yet another partition in favour of his son Charles at the assembly of Aachen in 837, which was implemented at the assembly of Worms 28 May 839 when he installed his sons Lothaire and Charles jointly, the former taking all land east of the River Meuse, the latter everything to the west, and set aside the claims of his son Louis and the successors of his late son Pepin. Lothaire succeeded as sole emperor on his father\u2019s death 20 Jun 840. He sought to extend his power base northwards from Italy across the Alps, and deprive his half-brother Charles. The latter allied himself with his half-brother Louis, and together they defeated Lothaire at Fontenoy-en-Puisaye, near Auxerre 25 Jun 841. After retreating to Aachen, Lothaire was forced out to Lyon in Apr 842 by his brothers, who declared him incapable of governing the empire. Preliminary peace proposals signed on an island in the Sa\u00f4ne, near M\u00e2con 15 Jun 842 led to the Treaty of Verdun 11 Aug 843, under which the territory of the empire was divided between the three brothers. Lothaire retained the imperial title and was also installed as LOTHAIRE I King of Lotharingia, a newly created territory covering a wide strip of land from the North Sea coast southwards to Italy, the new country being named after him. He established his seat of government at Aachen, and installed his son Louis as King of Italy. Over the following ten years, a series of meetings aimed to maintain peace between the three brothers, with varying success. After a serious illness, Emperor Lothaire abdicated in Sep 855 at Kloster Sch\u00fcller, near Pr\u00fcm, and divided his territories between his sons Louis II, Lothaire II and Charles. The Annales Bertiniani record that Emperor Lothaire entered monasterium Prone\u00e6 in Arduenna, was tonsured, died IV Kal Oct and was buried in the monastery[12]. The necrology of Pr\u00fcm records the death 855 III Kal Oct of Lotharius imperator[13]. #R##N##R##N#m (Thionville, Moselle mid-Oct 821) ERMENGARDE, daughter of HUGUES Comte [de Tours] [Etichonen] & his wife Ava --- (-20 Mar 851, bur Kloster Erstein, near Strasbourg). Thegan's Vita Hludowici Imperatoris refers to the wife of Emperor Lothaire as filiam Hugi comitis, qui erat de stirpe cuiusdam ducis nomine Etih and in the following paragraph names her Irmingarda[14]. The Annales Xantenses record the marriage in 821 of Ludewicus imperator\u2026filio suo Lothario and Ermingardam filiam Hugonis comitis Turonicorum[15]. She founded Kloster Erstein in Alsace in 849.

The Annales Fuldenses also record that Gisalbertus vassallus Karoli abducted filiam Hlotharii imperatoris and married her in Aquitaine in 846[22]. The Annales Mettenses also date this event in 846[23]. Settipani states that the emperor recognised the marriage in 849[24].

A letter from Hincmar Archbishop of Reims to Irmingardi august\u00e6, included by Flodoard in the Historia Remensis Ecclesi\u00e6, names Bert\u00e6, ipsius imperatricis fili\u00e6 referring to her activities at Avennaci monasterii, a later passage confirming that she was abbatiss\u00e6 Avennaci monasterii[26]. A poem by Sedulius is addressed to Berta\u2026proles\u2026Lothari\u2026Ermingardis matris[27]. Abbess of Avenay before 847. Maybe Abbess of Faremoutiers 852-after 877. m ([Worms autumn 841]) ---. Berta was married, as shown by a second poem by Sedulius addressed to Berta which names Ermingardis C\u00e6sareumque as her mother and refers to Bertha's earthly spouse\u2026now in heaven[28]. It is possible that she was the daughter Hlotharius\u2026fili\u00e6 su\u00e6 whose marriage is referred to at Worms in Autumn 841 in the Annals of Fulda [29]. Berta's husband has not been identified. #R##N##R##N#5. GISELA ([830]-860). The necrology of Brixen records that Domnus Imperator Lotharius tradidit filiam suam domnam Gislam[30].

LOTHAIRE ([835]-Piacenza 8 Aug 869, bur Convent of San Antonio near Piacenza). Regino names Hludowicum, Hlotharium et Carolum as the three sons of Emperor Lothaire & his wife[32]. Lothario rege is named filio imperatoris Lotharii by Folcuin[33]. The Annales Bertiniani record that Emperor Lothaire gave Frisia to his son Lothaire in 855[34]. He succeeded his father in 855 as LOTHAIRE II King of Lotharingia, with Aachen as his capital. He attempted to annul his marriage to marry his mistress of many years, but was opposed by Hincmar Archbishop of Reims, and later Pope Nicholas I who ordered him to return to his wife 15 Aug 865. He was negotiating with Pope Hadrian II for a new decision when he died of malaria[35]. On his death, his lands were divided between Ludwig II der Deutsche King of the East Franks and Charles II le Chauve King of the West Franks, instead of passing to his brother Emperor Louis despite the latter's objections. The necrology of Pr\u00fcm records the death 869 Kal Iul of Lotharius rex filius eius [=Lotharius imperator][36]. m ([855], separated 857, repudiated 860) TEUTBERGA, daughter of BOSO l'Ancien Comte d\u2019Arles & his wife --- (-Metz before 25 Nov 875, bur Metz, Abbaye de Sainte-Glossinde). The Annales Lobienses name Tietberga, sorore Hucberti abbatis as lawful wife of Lotharius[37]. The Annales Bertiniani name Teutbergam as materteram suam [=Bosone filio Buvini comitis][38]. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names Thieberga regina legitima uxore [Lotharii], specifying that she relied on the advice of Bosonis comitis at the time of her repudiation, although her relationship to him is not specified[39]. Herimannus names Tiohtpirga uxore legitima of King Lothaire II when recording his repudiation of her[40]. She protected the wife of Boso Count in Italy after she deserted her husband. She was repudiated on the grounds of her alleged incest with her brother Hugobert[41]. Her husband kept her prisoner after separating from her. The Annales Bertiniani record that uxor Lotharii fled to fratrem suum Hucbertum in regno Karli in 860[42]. She escaped in 860 and sought refuge with Charles II le Chauve who gave her the abbey of Avenay in the diocese of Reims. The Annales Bertiniani records that uxore [Lothario] gave support to uxori Bosonis et Balduino qui filiam eius [=Karoli regis] furatus fuerat in uxorem[43]. Abbess of Sainte Glossinde at Metz 869. Heccardus comes names \u2026Teutbergane uxore Lotharii\u2026 among the beneficiaries under his testamentary disposition dated to [Jan 876][44]. It is not certain that this refers to the separated wife of King Lothar II, but no other Teutberga/Lothaire couple has been identified at the time. If this identification is correct, it suggests a family relationship between Teutberga and Ecchard, which has not yet been identified. Mistress (1): (from [855]) WALDRADA, daughter of --- (-9 Apr after 868). One manuscript of the Gesta Treverorum names Waldradam sororem\u2026Guntheri Coloniensis archiepiscopus when recording her adulterous relationship with King Lothaire II[45]. The C\u00e6sarii Heisterbacensis Catalogus of archbishops of K\u00f6ln records that the concubine of Lotharius was Waldradam, sororem Guntheri archiepiscopi Coloniensis and that her brother encouraged Lothaire to leave his legitimate wife for Waldrada, for which he was excommunicated by the Pope[46]. The Annales Novesienses record that \u201cGuntherus episcopus Coloniensis\u201d had \u201csororem\u2026Vastradam\u2026aliis Waldradam\u201d whom \u201cdux Lotharingi\u00e6 Lotharius\u2026superdixit\u201d after her brother approved his divorce from \u201clegitima uxore Tyberga\u201d[47]. According to Baron Ernouf[48], Gunther archbishop of K\u00f6ln was uncle of Waldrada and Thetgaud archbishop of Trier was her brother, but the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. The Annales Bertiniani names Hlotharius Waldradam concubinam when recording that Lothaire purported to marry her in 862 and crowned her with the support of Liutfrido avunculo suo et Waltario[49]. Waldrada was also related to the Etichonen Grafen im Nordgau (ALSACE), as shown by the Vita Sancti Deicoli which names Waldrada\u2026Heberardo comitis consanguinitatis[50], but the precise relationship is not known. Folcuin records King Lothaire's excommunication after repudiating his wife for Waldrada[51]. King Lothaire purported to marry Waldrada in [Aug/Sep] 862 and crowned her as Queen, but this was not recognised by the church[52]. She became a nun at Remiremont. King Lothaire II had four illegitimate children by Mistress (1):#R##N##R##N#a) HUGUES ([855/60]-after 895). Duke of Alsace 867, until after Aug 869. The Annales Bertiniani record that King Lothaire invested filioque suo de Waldrada Hugoni with ducatum Elisatium in 867[53]. Herimannus names Hugonem, Lotharii regis ex Waldrada filium when recording his rebellion in 879[54]. After his father's death, Charles II le Chauve King of the West Franks invaded Alsace and Hugues was obliged to submit to him. The Gesta Francorum records that Hugo, Hlutharii et Waldrada filius caused tyranny in France in 879[55]. Pope John VIII excommunicated Hugonem Lotharii Regis quondam filium non legitimum in 878[56]. Hugues challenged Louis II le B\u00e8gue and his son Louis III le Jeune in Lotharingia in 879, but was defeated in 880 and swore allegiance at Gondreville in May 881 to Louis le Jeune who gave him the abbey of Lobbes. The Annales Fuldenses record that Ludwig II der Deutsche King of the East Franks sent legatis nepotum suorum to fight Hugonem tyrannidem exercentem in Gallia in 880[57]. Charles III le Gros King of the East Franks gave him domains of the bishopric of Metz in 882, but Hugues rebelled in the same year, was defeated once more and took refuge in Burgundy. He rebelled again in 885 and sought support from his brother-in-law Gotfrid in Frisia[58]. The Annales Vedastini record that Hugo\u2026filius Hlotharii regis was blinded in 885 on the advice of Heinrico duce[59]. He was shut in the monastery of Fulda, later transferred to Sankt-Gallen, and finally to the abbey of Pr\u00fcm[60]. m (883) as her fourth husband, FRIDERADA, widow firstly of ENGUERRAND, secondly of BERNARIUS, and thirdly of WICBERT, daughter of ---. Regino names Friderada as wife of Engilrammo ex qua filiam quam postmodem Richwinus comes in coniugem accepti, also referring to her subsequent marriages[61]. The Chronico Saxonico records that Hugo filius Lotharii Regis had Wicbertum comitem murdered and married his wife Frideradam in 883[62]. b) GISELA ([860/65]-[21 May/26 Oct] 907). Regino records the marriage in 882 of Gisla filia Hlotharii and rex Godofridus Nordmannorum[63]. The Annales Fuldenses record the marriage of Gotafrid Nordmannus qui superiore anno fuerat baptizatus and Hugone Hlutharii filio eiusque sororem in 883[64]. Abbess at Nivelles and Fosses, after her husband died. Zendeboldus\u2026rex gave proprietatem\u2026in loco\u2026VII Fontes to propinqua nostra\u2026Kisla\u2026regis Lotharii filia\u2026abbatisse by charter dated 30 Jul 896[65].

He was one of the leaders of the Danes who ravaged large parts of territory between the Rhine and the Somme. He converted to Christianity, and Emperor Charles le Gros granted him large parts of Frisia as dux. c) BERTA ([863]-8 Mar 925, bur Lucca, Santa Maria). Hugo comes et marchio names patris mei Teutbaldi et matris me\u00e6 Berthe\u2026 in a donation by charter dated 924[67]. Berte is also named as mother of Hugo rex in the latter's donation to Cluny for the souls of his parents dated 8 Mar 934[68]. Her parentage and first marriage are confirmed by the Annales Bertiniani which name Hugonem Lotharii iunioris filium and \u201csororium illius Theutbaldum\u201d in 880[69]. Her origin and second marriage are confirmed by the epitaph of Comitiss\u00e6\u2026Bertha specifies that she was uxor Adalberti Ducis Itali\u00e6\u2026regalis generi\u2026filia Lotharii and records her death in 925[70]. Liudprand provides the proof that Berta, who married Marchese Adalberto, was the widow of Theotbald when he names Berta matre regis Hugonis, specifying that she was previously married to Adalberto, when recording her death[71]. She was regent of Tuscany after the death of her second husband in 915. m firstly ([879/80]) THEOTBALD [Thibaut] Comte d\u2019Arles, son of HUBERT d'Arles, Comte de Transjuranie & his wife --- (-[Jun 887]/[895]). m secondly ([895/98]) ADALBERTO II Marchese of Tuscany, Conte e Duca di Lucca, son of ADALBERT I Marchese of Tuscany & his wife Rothildis of Spoleto (-[10/19] Sep 915, bur Lucca Cathedral). d) ERMENGARDE (-6 Aug after [895/898], bur Lucca, Santa Giustina). Her epitaph at Lucca records the death VIII Id Aug of Ermingardis\u2026dicata deo as daughter of rex\u2026Lotharius[72]. Nun at Santa Giustina in Lucca. Gingins-la-Sarra suggests that Ermengarde was the wife of Berlion [I] Vicomte de Vienne, suggesting that she went to Provence with her sister Berta who married Thibaut Comte d\u00b4Arles[73]. He says that the charter dated 25 Dec 923, under which \u201cLudwicus\u2026imperator augustus\u201d confirmed property \u201cin comitatu Viennensi seu et in Lugdunensi in villa\u2026Tadernaco\u201d to \u201cIngelbertus\u2026et uxori eius Nonie\u201d (Engelbert being this couple\u00b4s son)[74], refers to Engelbert as \u201cpropinquus\u201d of the emperor. He says that the term was never used in charters which name Berlion [I] and therefore deduces that the relationship must have been through Engelbert\u00b4s mother. However, the text of the charter in question does not appear to apply the word \u201cpropinquus\u201d specifically to Engelbert. It is used in the phrase \u201cpropinquorum et fidelium suorum\u201d, as part of the introductory words in the charter, while Engelbert is named in the document as \u201cfidelis noster\u201d. There appears to be no other basis for this speculation. If the hypothesis were correct, it would be difficult to explain why Ermengarde would have left Provence (presumably after the death of her supposed husband, dated to [912]) and established herself as a nun at Lucca, while her two sons remained in Provence. #R##N##R##N#7.

Hlawitschka suggests that she was the daughter of Emperor Lothaire I, as her son's charter dated 28 Jan 870 records that the property he donated to the abbey of Tournus had been granted to his father by Emperor Lothaire[77]. However, the copy of the charter reproduced in the Histoire de Tournus, cited above, states that the property had been donated to Wicbert by senioris mei Hlotharii Regis. m ([850/51]) LAMBERT Comte et Marquis de Nantes, son of LAMBERT [I] Comte et Marquis de Nantes [Guidonen] & his wife [--- of Italy] (-killed in battle 1 May 852).] #R##N##R##N#8.

He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as Blowin' in the Wind and The Times They Are a-Changin' became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single Like a Rolling Stone, recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. Dylan's mid-1960s recordings, backed by rock musicians, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.#R##N##R##N#wikipedia Talk:Bob Dylan/Archive 8 - ...

She joined her husband Zigman Zimmerman, emigrating from Odessa (on the Black Sea, in present-day Ukraine) to the US by 1910. The sentence in the article acknowledges Dylan's version in Chronicles: In his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kyrgyz and her family originated from Istanbul.#R##N##R##N#One problem is that the information on Anna's death certificate contradicts Dylan's version. The death certificate was signed by her oldest son Maurice (Bob Dylan's uncle), and it states that she was born in Odessa. This is how Michael Gray summarizes it in The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, pp 729-730, under the heading Zimmerman family:#R##N##R##N#Anna, who had also moved to Hibbing, and lived for some years with Bob\u2019s Uncle Maurice, moved into a nursing home way down in St. Paul and died there of arteriosclerosis on April 20, 1955. Her death certificate, with the information supplied by Uncle Maurice, confirmed that she\u2019d been born in Odessa. Dylan contradicts this, writing in Chronicles: Volume One of visiting her when she still lived in Duluth: she \u2018had only one leg and had been a seamstress. \u2026 She\u2019d come to America from Odessa.[but] Originally she\u2019d come from Turkey, sailed from Trabzon, a port town, across the Black Sea. . . . Her family was from Kagizman, a town in Turkey near the Armenian border, and the family name had been Kirghiz. My grandfather\u2019s parents had also come from that area. . . . My grandmother\u2019s ancestors had been from Constantinople.\u2019 #R##N##R##N#I think we should leave the sentence in the article, as it acknowledges Dylan's account of his family history in Chronicles, even though the documents do not confirm his version. Mick gold (talk) 23:41, 12 December 2010 (UTC)#R##N##R##N#He clearly accepts the fact that he has Turkish roots, and this article must illustrate this.

Born into a musical family, McVie's father, Cyril Perfect, was an accomplished violinist and music lecturer at St Peter's College of Education, Saltley. He remained active in the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra into his mid-eighties. Her mother Beatrice (Tee, n\u00e9e Reece) was a medium, psychic and faith healer. McVie's grandfather was an organist at Westminster Abbey. Introduced to the piano at the age of four, McVie did not study music until age 11, continuing her classical training until age 15. She then shifted her musical focus to Rock and Roll. It is said that she became addicted to Rock and Roll from the very first time she looked through a Fats Domino songbook. While studying sculpture at Birmingham Art College, she got caught in the throes of the blues revival that was sweeping England. She made some duo appearances with Spencer Davis (before he teamed with Steve Winwood and Muff Windwood for the ignition of the Spencer Davis Group). Christine then met Stan Webb and Andy Silvester and joined them in the band, Sounds of Blue. By the time McVie graduated from college with a teaching degree, Sounds of Blue dismembered; McVie, unable to gather funds to find a place in the world of visual arts, took her teaching diploma to London where she worked briefly as a department store window dresser for Regent Street department store. However, after learning Webb and Silvester were scouting a pianist to join their band, Chicken Shack, she wrote them with request to join--they invited her to play keyboards/piano and to sing backing vocals. Chicken Shack debuted with It's Okay With Me Baby, written by and featuring McVie. With two albums in, Chicken Shack found success with I'd Rather Go Blind, a song originally recorded by Etta James in 1967. The song featured McVie on lead vocals. McVie earned a Melody Maker award for female vocalist of the year and lauded for having one of the top 10 pairs of legs in all of Britain. While touring with Chicken Shack, the band would often meet with Fleetwood Mac (they shared the same label at Blue Horizon). Fleetwood Mac asked her to play piano as a session musician for Peter Green's songs on the band's second album, Mr. Wonderful. McVie left Chicken Shack after marrying Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie. She continued her career with the recording of a solo album, Christine Perfect; following her success as a member of Fleetwood Mac, the album was reissued under the name of the Legendary Christine Perfect Album. By the time she had joined Fleetwood Mac full-time, she had already contributed backup vocals and painted the cover for Kiln House (the fourth studio album recorded by Fleetwood Mac). Peter Green had left the band, leaving Fleetwood Mac with reservations to perform live without him. Having been a huge fan of the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac; and versed in all the lyrics to their songs, she joined in. In 1974, with the band, McVie reluctantly relocated to the United States in effort to make a fresh start. Within a year, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined the band. With a new lineup, their first album together, titled Fleetwood Mac, found success with McVie's songs Over My Head and Say You Love Me both reaching Billboard's top-20 singles chart. The band sold 4 million copies of Fleetwood Mac and over 15 million of its follow-up, Rumours. From the album, McVie's You Make Loving Fun found a place on the top-10, and Don't Stop peaked to the #3, and years later became the song President Bill Clinton played for his Presidential campaign, and at his 1993 inaugural Gala (McVie and her band mates performed there, as well as as the Super Bowl a few days later). The success of Rumours earned the band many accolades; however, by the end of touring for the album, McVie divorced from John Mcvie. In 1979, the band released Tusk, the album was considered a disappointment, merely because it was impossible for any future releases to meet the success of Rumours. Three years later, the band reunited to record Mirage, which featured the top-5 hit Hold Me; McVie's inspiration for the song was her tumultuous relationship with Dennis Wilson, the drummer for the The Beach Boys. Wilson drowned in accident a few years later, leaving McVie heartbroken. In 1984, McVie released her second solo album, simply titled, Christine McVie. The album featured the hit Got a Hold on Me, positioning in the Top 10 pop, and #1 adult contemporary. She also met keyboardist Eddy Quintela (12 years her junior), they married two years later (October 1986). Although they divorced a decade later, they wrote several songs together, including Little Lies and As Long as You Follow, two songs that became hits for Fleetwood Mac. The solo album also features McVie's cover of Elvis Presley's Can't Help Falling In Love, the song was featured in the Howie Mandel film A Fine Mess (1986). A year later, she reunited with Fleetwood Mac for the recording of the band's fourteenth studio album, Tango in the Night. The album went on to become the band's biggest success since Rumours, ten years earlier. Always reluctant to tour, preferring to stay close to home and friends and family, and upon the death of her father, (while she was touring for Behind the Mask) (Fleetwood Mac's fifteenth studio album), McVie made the decision to retire from touring altogether. In 1998, she reunited with the band for the release of the live album, the Dance, which reached #1 on the US album charts. The same year, despite her reservations, she toured with the band for the group's 1998 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the Grammy Awards show, and the BRIT Awards. McVie returned to England to be near her family and stayed out of public view until 2000, when she appeared to accept an Honorary Doctorate in music from the University of Greenwich. 2000 also saw the release of In the Meantime, McVie's third solo album. No tour was organized, but McVie delivered several press interviews in both Britain and the United States. In 2013, she appeared on stage in Maui, Hawaii performing with the Mick Fleetwood Blues Band (her first live appearance in 15 years). Later in September, McVie performed live with Fleetwood Mac in London (also, for the first time in 15 years) to perform Don't Stop. Shortly after, Mick Fleetwood announced during a concert in Maui that McVie would be rejoining the band, it was officially announced two days later, she had rejoined. The original Rumours lineup (Nicks, Buckingham, Fleetwood, McVie, and McVie). In June, 2017, McVie teamed up with Lindsey Buckingham for the recording and release of Lindsey Buckingham/Christine McVie; the album sold over 22,000 units in the US in its first week and debuted within the top 20.

He has also played or produced music from the noisier, more aggressive end of the rock spectrum, such as hardcore punk and metal. According to music critic Chris Brazier, Laswell's pet concept is 'collision music' which involves bringing together musicians from wildly divergent but complementary spheres and seeing what comes out. The credo of one record label run by Laswell, and which typifies much of his work, is Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted. Though projects arranged by Laswell may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically: Material began as a noisy dance music project, but subsequent releases have been centered on hip hop, jazz, or backing spoken word readings by beat generation icon William S.

He was brought up in a council flat in less than prosperous conditions, the son of deaf and volatile parents in a dysfunctional family setting. He had to learn sign language at an early age. His world did not include television and he had to explain to his father what music sounded like. Despite these obstacles, Griffiths developed a talent for dialects which later allowed him to shine in a number of ethnic portrayals. In films from 1975 on both sides of the Atlantic, his better roles have been in both contemporary and period pieces, such a Gorky Park (1983), Withnail & I (1987), King Ralph (1991), Guarding Tess (1994), Sleepy Hollow (1999) and recently the 'Harry Potter' series as Uncle Vernon Dursley. In a 2007 interview Griffiths declared I like playing Vernon Dursley in Harry Potter because that gives me a licence to be horrible to kids. I hate the odious business of sucking up to the public. In fact, unlike those jovial characters he so often portrayed on screen, Griffiths did not tolerate fools gladly. On occasion, he would get stroppy with members of an audience, notably those failing to switch off their mobile phones during a performance (then again, who could blame him ?). He was also highly thought of as a raconteur and wit. The ever-versatile, often bespectacled and bearded Griffiths did his best work for the small screen, particularly excelling as the inquisitive and resourceful civil servant Henry Jay in Bird of Prey (1982) and as the lovable 'cooking policeman' Henry Crabbe in Pie in the Sky (1994), a role specially created for him. As comic relief he made many a hilarious guest appearance, in, among other popular series, The Vicar of Dibley (1994) (as the Bishop of Mulberry) and as Dr. Bayham Badger in the superb BBC adaption of Bleak House (2005). He could also play evil and sinister, none more so than Swelter in Gormenghast (2000), a character Griffiths described being at once laughably comic and a monster like Idi Amin. One of Britain's best-loved character actors, Griffiths received an OBE in 2008. He died on March 28 2013 as a result of complications from heart surgery."}

He is acknowledged by many as one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century. Stravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes: The Firebird (1910), Petrushka (1911) and The Rite of Spring (1913). The Rite of Spring, which provoked a riot during its premiere, transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His so-called Russian phase was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to neoclassical music. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms (concerto grosso, fugue and symphony). They frequently concealed a vein of intense emotion beneath a surface appearance of detachment or austerity and often paid tribute to the music of earlier masters, for example J.S. Bach and Tchaikovsky. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted serial procedures. His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note cells and clarity of form, of instrumentation and of utterance.#R##N##R##N#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky Ruski skladatelj ukrajinskog porijekla kojeg danas mnogi, i na zapadu i u njegovoj rodnoj domovini, smatraju najutjecajnijim skladateljem glazbe XX. stolje\u0107a!#R##N##R##N#http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinski#R##N##R##N#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky#R##N##R##N#http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9,_%D0%98%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8C_%D0%A4%D1%91%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87", "user_response_answer": "1", "entity2": "David Tanenbaum <S> award.competitor award.nominee award.winner biology.deceased_organism biology.organism book.author broadcast.artist event.agent film.actor film.music_contributor media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.dedicator media_common.subject music.artist music.composer music.lyricist music.musician music.producer music.songwriter organization.founder organization.member people.deceased_person people.person ratings.rated_entity tv.actor book.subject <S> Populist composer credited with developing the American style of composition.

Weyl published technical and some general works on space, time, matter, philosophy, logic, symmetry and the history of mathematics. He was one of the first to conceive of combining general relativity with the laws of electromagnetism. While no mathematician of his generation aspired to the 'universalism' of Henri Poincar\u00e9 or Hilbert, Weyl came as close as anyone.

At the age of 13, he first began to play a guitar that his father had left him following his parents' separation, and he managed to teach himself how to play it despite being left-handed, and the instrument being right-handed. As a teenager, he often got into trouble with the police and was expelled from school when he was 15. But it was one night that both he and his brother, Liam Gallagher, were at a gig by fellow working class Mancunians The Stone Roses, that he realised that a career in music was possible. In the late 1980s, Noel toured with the Inspiral Carpets as a roadie and guitar technician and, when he heard that their frontman Steve Holt was leaving the band, he auditioned to be their new lead singer, but was turned down. In 1991 Gallagher was asked to join another local band called The Rain, as brother Liam, who was their lead singer, had petitioned the other band members to let him approach his older brother to be their lead guitarist. Liam changed the band's name to Oasis and, after Noel had joined, they were offered a worldwide major label record deal with Sony Music in 1993, which in turn would license their recordings to the indie label Creation Records in the UK. The band went on to have the UK's fastest selling debut album of all-time with their 1994 release, Definitely Maybe, and enjoyed huge amounts of success throughout the mid-1990s as a prominent force in the Britpop movement.
