Jon Voight earned his net worth thanks to a high successful film and television acting career. He has won several Golden Globe Awards and continues to pursue acting. Voight is also known for having a troubled relationship with his daughter, A-listed Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie. Born Jonathan Vincent Jon Voight on December 29, 1938, in Yonkers, New York, Voight discovered his love for acting as a teenager. After a stint on Broadway, this baby-faced and blue-eyed actor made his debut with the 1965 feature movie, Fearless Frank. But it was his portrayal of hustler Joe Buck in the ground-breaking drama, Midnight Cowboy (1969), that fetched him an Oscar nomination and catapulted his career into the big time. Voight's other notable movie appearances include performances in such movies as Hour of the Gun (1967), The Revolutionary (1970), Deliverance (1972) and Out of It (1978). Over the years, he has won one Academy Award out of four nominations, and three Golden Globe Awards out of nine nominations. The Academy Award he had received was for Best Actor for his portrayal of a quadriplegic Vietnam War veteran, alongside Jane Fonda, in the drama-romance Coming Home (1978). Throughout the 1980s, he performed in a string of hit and miss films including in critically-acclaimed action drama Runaway Train (1985). Then, there was a period of spiritual reawakening, during which he worked on a number of intellectually related but doomed film projects. Once he starred opposite Robert De Niro in the 1995 blockbuster Heat, Voight again got the chance to star in big budget offerings. Thus, Mission: Impossible (1996) and Enemy of the State (1998) regained his status as big-budget star; while Varsity Blues (1999), Ali (2001) and Pearl Harbor (2001) earned him critical acclaim aside from fame. He has also appeared opposite his real life daughter, Angelina Jolie, in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001).

One of these, known as the old or ancient castle, was by legend founded by Wada, a 6th-century ruler of Hälsingland. The second castle, (54.4935°N 0.7055°W) caput of the feudal barony of Mulgrave, was of Norman construction and remained active until destroyed by order of Parliament in 1647. The third is a country house (54.5012°N 0.6922°W) which was constructed by Lady Catherine Darnley and passed in 1718 by marriage into the Phipps family, when her daughter Lady Catherine Annesley married William Phipps. The Phipps family later held the titles of Baron Mulgrave, Earl of Mulgrave and Marquess of Normanby.#R##N#.... etc.#R##N#A second castle, which occupied the entire width of the ridge, seems to have been Norman, presumably constructed by Nigel Fossard (d. about 1120), who obtained the property after the Norman Conquest.[1] Fossard is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a tenant of 114 manors, all in Yorkshire, including under Robert, Count of Mortain of Grif, identified as Mulgrave in the hundred of Langbaurgh.[2] He became himself a tenant-in-chief of the king in 1088, and a holder of the large feudal barony whose caput was at Mulgrave, hence known as the barony of Mulgrave, which according to the Cartae Baronum return made in 1166 comprised 33 1/2 knight's fees.[3] The main approach was located on the west, with two stone towers overlooking the entrance.[1] Moats prohibited approach from the east and ensured that western approach was by means of a drawbridge.[4] Differing levels of land surrounding the containing walls caused the wall to bulge outwards, which required buttressing.[1] Some of the bricks used in the structure are clearly Roman.[1]#R##N#Nigel Fossard's son Robert died c.1135, Robert's son William I d. c. 1170, leaving a son William II who died in 1195 leaving an heiress Joan, who brought the barony and castle to her husband Robert de Turnham (d.1211). Their only surviving child and heiress was Isabel de Turnham who brought the barony and castle to Peter de Mauley (or Maulay) (d.1241) to whom she had been granted in marriage by King John on the escheatment of the barony. De Mauley was a native of Poitou, whose marriage to this wealthy heiress is said to have been his reward for having murdered in 1203 Prince Arthur, the son of John's elder brother who threatened his succession to the throne.[5] He was governor of Corfe Castle in Dorset where he acted as jailer of Eleanor, Arthur's sister.[6] Peter I's heir was Peter II de Mauley (1226–1279), who married Joan de Brus (d.1243), one of five sisters of Peter III de Brus (d.1272), feudal baron of Skelton, Yorkshire, who was his brother-in-law, having married Hilary de Mauley, Peter II's sister.[7] In the time of Peter II the barony was held by knight service of supplying two knights in time of war in the king's presence for 40 days per annum.[8] Peter II's heir was Peter III de Mauley (d.1308), who married Nicole de Ghent (d. before 1302), sister and in her issue co-heir (in a 1/3rd share) to Gilbert V de Ghent (d.1298), feudal baron of Folkingham, Lincolnshire.[9] Peter III was summoned to parliament by writ dated 23 June 1296,[10] creating him the 1st Baron de Mauley.[11] Peter III's seal can be seen as one of 72 appended to the Barons' Letter, 1301 to the Pope[12] sealed at the Parliament of Lincoln in January 1301, and shows him on the reverse in the usual pose for early seals holding sword and shield astride his galloping war-horse, with the tails of his surcoat swept back by the wind. His arms within a heater-shaped escutcheon show a bend with a field diapered with scroll-work, which are blazoned as borne by him on the Falkirk Roll (1298) as: Or, a bend sable.[13] His heir was Peter IV de Mauley (d.1348).[14] Camden states that the first Peter was succeeded by 7 others bearing his name.#R##N#The castle passed to Sir John Bigot (c.1376-1426/7) of Settrington, Yorks.,[15] on his marriage to Constance de Mauley (c.1385-15/12/1450), eldest daughter & co-heiress of Peter VII de Mauley (d.1378), whose son Peter VIII had died in 1415 without issue, when the Barony de Mauley by writ became extinct. Bigot was 5th in descent from Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk (d.1225).#R##N#.... etc.#R##N#From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulgrave_Castle#R##N##R##N##R##N#_______________________

Name an event similar to battle of sirte? <EOS> Second Gulf of Sidra offensive <EOS> Where did it take place? <SP> Battle of Sirte <S> military.conflict time.event <S> The Battle of Sirte (also spelled Surt) was the final battle of the Libyan Civil War, beginning when the National Liberation Army attacked the last remnants of the Libyan army still loyal to Muammar Gaddafi in his hometown and designated capital of Sirte, on the Gulf of Sidra. As of September 2011, Sirte and Bani Walid were the last strongholds of Gaddafi loyalists and the NTC hoped that the fall of Sirte would bring the war to an end. The battle and its aftermath marked the final collapse of the four-decade Gaddafi regime. Both Gaddafi and his son, Mutassim, were wounded and captured, and tortured and killed in custody less than an hour later. The month-long battle left Sirte almost completely in ruins, with many buildings damaged or totally destroyed. <SP> Second Gulf of Sidra offensive <S> time.event military.conflict <S> The Second Gulf of Sidra offensive was a military operation in the Libyan Civil War conducted by rebel anti-Gaddafi forces in August and September 2011 to take control of towns along the Gulf of Sidra in an effort to surround Muammar Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte, which was held by pro-Gaddafi forces.

The Gaddafi loyalists in the area were finally defeated when NTC fighters captured Sirte.

Joan Baez was born January 9, 1941 in Staten Island, New York City, New York. She is known for topical songs promoting social justice, civil rights and pacifism. Baez also played a critical role in popularizing Bob Dylan, with whom she performed regularly in the mid-1960s. In the turbulent '60s in America, Baez often used her music to express her social and political views. Not long after the release of her first album (1960), she met the then-unknown singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In the early to mid-1960s, Joan Baez became an established folk artist as well as a voice for social change, singing We Shall Overcome at the March on Washington in 1963 (organized by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.). In 1964, she would refuse to pay part of her taxes to protest U.S. military spending. Baez was arrested twice in 1967 in Oakland, California for blocking an armed forces induction center. Baez continued to be active politically and musically in the '70s. She helped establish the west coast branch of Amnesty International, a human rights organization, and released numerous albums, including the critically acclaimed Diamonds and Rust (1975). In addition to touring, she also performed at many benefits and fundraisers for social and political causes around the world. In 1980, Baez was given honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degrees by Antioch University and Rutgers University for her political activism and the universality of her music. In 1983, she appeared on the Grammy Awards, performing Dylan's anthem Blowin' in the Wind, a song she first performed twenty years earlier. On October 14, 2009, PBS aired an episode of its documentary series, American Masters entitled Joan Baez: How Sweet the Sound. <SP> the Beatles <S> film.subject award.competitor award.hall_of_fame_inductee award.nominee award.winner biology.organism book.author book.subject broadcast.artist cvg.computer_game_subject event.agent film.music_contributor internet.social_network_user media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.subject music.artist music.group music.lyricist music.producer organization.founder ratings.rated_entity tv.actor <S> The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.

He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as Blowin' in the Wind and The Times They Are a-Changin' became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single Like a Rolling Stone, recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. Dylan's mid-1960s recordings, backed by rock musicians, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.#R##N##R##N#wikipedia Talk:Bob Dylan/Archive 8 - ... His Turkish ethnicity#R##N##R##N#... This quote comes from Bob Dylan's very own book in 'Chronicles: Volume One'. He says the following: My grandmother's ancestors had been from Constantinople. As a teenager, I used to sing the Ritchie Valens song 'In a Turkish Town' with the lines in it about the 'mystery Turks and the stars above,' and it seemed to suit me more than 'La Bamba.' (pg. 93). You can also find this quote cited in many articles see for example [36] (page 28) and [37] —Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.145.8.128 (talk) 11:28, 12 December 2010 (UTC)#R##N##R##N#Recently I found out this, Dylan’s mother was born Beatrice R. Stone in 1915, and had an older brother, Vernon. Two younger siblings followed, Lewis and Irene. All born in the US, they were the children of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants Benjamin David Solemovitz (born 1883), who changed Solemovitz to Stone, and his wife Florence Sara nee Edelstein, herself one of ten children.#R##N##R##N#Taking Florence Sara first: the Florence who would become Bob Dylan’s grandmother—she and the other nine Edelstein children were in turn the sons and daughters of Benjamin Harold Edelstein (born 1870) and Lybba nee Jaffe, from Kovno (Kaunas) in Lithuania. (Benjamin Harold’s parents were David and Ida Edelstein; Ida’s parents were Yehuda Aron and Rachel ne´e Berkovitz. Lybba Jaffe’s parents were Aaron Jaffe and Fannie.)  (from The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia by Michael Gray, pg.641-642).--Sayantan m (talk) 15:11, 12 December 2010 (UTC) #R##N##R##N#Dylan's reference in Chronicles (p. 93) is not to his maternal grandmother but to his father's mother, Anna Zimmerman, née Chana Greenstein. She joined her husband Zigman Zimmerman, emigrating from Odessa (on the Black Sea, in present-day Ukraine) to the US by 1910. The sentence in the article acknowledges Dylan's version in Chronicles: In his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kyrgyz and her family originated from Istanbul.#R##N##R##N#One problem is that the information on Anna's death certificate contradicts Dylan's version. The death certificate was signed by her oldest son Maurice (Bob Dylan's uncle), and it states that she was born in Odessa. This is how Michael Gray summarizes it in The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, pp 729-730, under the heading Zimmerman family:#R##N##R##N#Anna, who had also moved to Hibbing, and lived for some years with Bob’s Uncle Maurice, moved into a nursing home way down in St. Paul and died there of arteriosclerosis on April 20, 1955. Her death certificate, with the information supplied by Uncle Maurice, confirmed that she’d been born in Odessa.

Dandridge, a cabinet maker and minister. Under the prodding of her mother, Dorothy and her sister Vivian Dandridge began performing publicly, usually in black Baptist churches throughout the country. Her mother would often join her daughters on stage. As the depression worsened, Dorothy and her family picked up and moved to Los Angeles where they had hopes of finding better work, perhaps in film. Her first film was in the Marx Brothers comedy, A Day at the Races (1937). It was only a bit part but Dorothy had hopes that it would blossom into something better. But because she was a black woman in a very prejudiced society, she didn't land the roles that were readily available to her white counterparts. She did not appear in another film until 1940 in Four Shall Die (1940). The role was nothing great other than to establish the fact that she was very beautiful and talented. Her next few roles in the early forties included films such as Bahama Passage (1941), Drums of the Congo (1942) and Hit Parade of 1943 (1943). There were others in between, of course, but they were the usual black stereotypical films for women such as Dorothy. Not only was she a talented actress but she could also sing which was evident in films such as Atlantic City (1944) and Pillow to Post (1945). This helped to showcase her talents as a singer and brought her headline acts in the nation's finest hotel nightclubs in New York, Miami, Chicago and Las Vegas. She may have been allowed to sing in these fine hotels but, because of racism, she couldn't stay there. It was reported that one hotel drained its swimming pool to keep her from enjoying that little amenity. In 1954, Dorothy appeared in the all-black production of Carmen Jones (1954) in the title role. She was so superb in that picture that she garnered an Academy Award nomination but lost out to Grace Kelly in The Country Girl (1954). Despite the nomination for her performance, Dorothy did not get another movie until she appeared in Tamango (1958), which was an Italian film. She was to make six more motion pictures, of which Island in the Sun (1957) and Porgy and Bess (1959) were worthy of mention. Once again, she was a standout. The last movie she would ever play would be in 1961's The Murder Men (1961). Dorothy faded quickly after that with a poor second marriage to Jack Denison (her first was to Harold Nicholas), poor investments, other financial woes, and a problem with alcohol. She was found dead in her West Hollywood apartment on September 8, 1965, the victim of a barbiturate poisoning. She was only 42. Had she been born 20 years later, Dorothy Dandridge would no doubt be one of the most well-known actresses in film history. <SP> Julie Wilson <S> award.nominee award.competitor people.person event.agent biology.organism film.actor tv.actor theater.actor ratings.rated_entity people.deceased_person music.musician music.artist media_common.cataloged_instance <S> American Actress Julie Wilson was born Julie May Wilson on 21st October, 1924 in Omaha, Nebraska USA and passed away on 5th Apr 2015 Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA aged 90.

State the name of the album prior to sweetheart of the rodeo <EOS> The Notorious Byrd Brothers <EOS> What is its style? <SP> Sweetheart of the Rodeo <S> award.winning_work commerce.consumer_product commerce.product media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work music.album ratings.rated_entity <S> Sweetheart of the Rodeo is the sixth album by American rock band The Byrds and was released on August 30, 1968 on Columbia Records. Recorded with the addition of country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons, it was influential as the first major country-rock album by an established act and represented a stylistic move away from the psychedelic rock of the band's previous LP, The Notorious Byrd Brothers. The Byrds had occasionally experimented with country music on their four previous albums, but Sweetheart of the Rodeo represented their fullest immersion into the genre thus far. The album was also responsible for bringing Gram Parsons, who had joined The Byrds prior to the recording of the album, to the attention of a mainstream rock audience for the first time. Thus, the album can be seen as an important chapter in Parsons' personal and musical crusade to make country music fashionable for a young audience. The album was initially conceived as a musical history of 20th century American popular music, encompassing examples of country music, jazz and rhythm and blues, among other genres. <SP> The Notorious Byrd Brothers <S> commerce.consumer_product commerce.product media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work music.album ratings.rated_entity <S> The Notorious Byrd Brothers is the fifth album by the American rock band the Byrds and was released in January 1968 on Columbia Records (see 1968 in music). Musically, the album represents the height of the Byrds' psychedelic experimentation, with the band blending together elements of folk rock, psychedelic rock, country music, electronic music, baroque pop and jazz on many of the songs. Of these disparate styles, the subtle country and western influences evident on a number of tracks pointed towards the full-blown country rock direction that the band would pursue on their next album. In addition, The Notorious Byrd Brothers saw the band and record producer Gary Usher making extensive use of a number of studio effects and production techniques, including phasing, flanging, and spatial panning. The Byrds also introduced the sound of the pedal steel guitar and the Moog modular synthesizer into their music for the first time on the album, making it one of the first LP releases on which the Moog appears.

And to go along with his net worth, he had the respect and admiration of millions of his peers and fans. His career, spanning many years, began in a gospel group called The Gospel Starlighters. The group eventually changed their name to The Flames, and toured (with Brown in tow) many venues in the south. The early recordings made during this time show a heavy influence from R&B artists like Little Richard and Ray Charles. From these early days, James Brown eventually evolved into a solo performer, but his music continued to grow and change. He spanned a wide variety of genres, including gospel and rhythm and blues in the early days, to incorporating elements of funk and traditional African music into his work. In the 70s, James Brown coped with the changing trends in music by experimenting with disco, but most of these efforts failed to match the success of his earlier work, most of which is much more popular than disco is today. After many tumultuous later years, James Brown died on Christmas Day, 2006. <SP> Sacred System <S> award.competitor award.nominee biology.organism broadcast.artist event.agent film.actor film.music_contributor media_common.cataloged_instance music.artist music.composer music.engineer music.lyricist music.musician music.producer people.person ratings.rated_entity tv.actor tv.personality <S> Bill Laswell is an American bassist, producer and record label owner. Laswell ranks among the most prolific of modern musicians, being involved in hundreds of recordings with many collaborators from all over the world. Laswell's music draws upon many different genres, most notably funk, various world music, jazz, dub and ambient styles. He has also played or produced music from the noisier, more aggressive end of the rock spectrum, such as hardcore punk and metal. According to music critic Chris Brazier, Laswell's pet concept is 'collision music' which involves bringing together musicians from wildly divergent but complementary spheres and seeing what comes out. The credo of one record label run by Laswell, and which typifies much of his work, is Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted. Though projects arranged by Laswell may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically: Material began as a noisy dance music project, but subsequent releases have been centered on hip hop, jazz, or backing spoken word readings by beat generation icon William S. Burroughs.

His paintings are noted for their tonal subtlety in depicting apparently simple subjects, which were limited mainly to vases, bottles, bowls, flowers and landscapes. <SP> Paolo Uccello <S> book.author event.agent media_common.cataloged_instance people.person ratings.rated_entity visual_art.visual_artist people.deceased_person biology.deceased_organism biology.organism <S> Paolo Uccello (Italian pronunciation: [ˈpaːolo utˈtʃɛllo], 1397 – 10 December 1475), born Paolo di Dono, was an Italian painter and mathematician who was notable for his pioneering work on visual perspective in art. In his book Lives of the Artists <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari>Giorgio Vasari</a> wrote that Uccello was obsessed by his interest in perspective and would stay up all night in his study trying to grasp the exact vanishing point. While his contemporaries used perspective to narrate different or succeeding stories, Uccello used perspective to create a feeling of depth in his paintings. His best known works are the three paintings representing the battle of San Romano, which were wrongly entitled the Battle of Sant' Egidio of 1416 for a long period of time. ; ;Paolo worked in the <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/international-gothic>Late Gothic</a> tradition, emphasizing colour and pageantry rather than the classical realism that other artists were pioneering. His style is best described as idiosyncratic, and he left no school of followers. He has had some influence on twentieth-century art and literary criticism (e.g., in the Vies imaginaires by Marcel Schwob, Uccello le poil by Antonin Artaud and O Mundo Como Ideia by Bruno Tolentino). ; ;The sources for Paolo Uccello’s life are few: <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari>Giorgio Vasari</a>’s biography, written 75 years after Paolo’s death, and a few contemporary official documents. Due to the lack of sources, even his date of birth is questionable. It is believed that Uccello was born in Pratovecchio in 1397, and his tax declarations for some years indicate that he was born in 1397, but in 1446 he claimed to be born in 1396. His father, Dono di Paolo, was a barber-surgeon from Pratovecchio near Arezzo, his mother, Antonia, was a high-born Florentine. His nickname Uccello came from his fondness for painting birds. ; ;From 1412 until 1416 he was apprenticed to the famous sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti. Ghiberti was the designer of the doors of the Florence Baptistery and his workshop was the premier centre for Florentine art at the time. Ghiberti's late-Gothic, narrative style and sculptural composition greatly influenced Paolo. It was also around this time that Paolo began his lifelong friendship with <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello>Donatello</a>. In 1414, Uccello was admitted to the <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/guild-of-saint-luke>painters' guild</a>, Compagnia di San Luca, and just one year later, in 1415, he joined the official painter's guild of Florence Arte dei Medici e degli Speziali. Although the young Uccello had probably left Ghiberti's workshop by the mid 1420s, he stayed on good terms with his master and may have been privy to the designs for Ghiberti's second set of Baptistery doors, The Gates of Paradise. These featured a battle scene that might well have impressed itself in the mind of the young Uccello, and thus influenced The Battle of San Romano. ; ;According to <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari>Vasari</a>, Uccello’s first painting was a Saint Anthony between the saints Cosmas and Damianus, a commission for the hospital of Lelmo. Next, he painted two figures in the convent of Annalena. Shortly afterwards, he painted three frescoes with scenes from the life of Saint Francis above the left door of the Santa Trinita church. For the Santa Maria Maggiore church, he painted a fresco of the Annunciation. In this fresco, he painted a large building with columns in perspective. According to Vasari, people found this to be a great and beautiful achievement because this was the first example of how lines could be expertly used to demonstrate perspective and size. As a result, this work became a model for artists who wished to craft illusions of space in order to enhance the realness of their paintings.

Most celebrities are not always in love with the constant flow of attention but that by no means describes Nick Lachey as he simply love the limelight. Nick is a successful singer of the boy band 98 degrees and has successfully transitioned into the world of Television, Movie production and has released multiple Solo albums as a singer, all this has earned him a net worth of $22 Million.Nick is highly educated and has a lot of experience travelling, he loves to sing and that’s the primary reason he would be singing all day long in his days in college, Then it wasn’t long before he and his brother drew were part of a band that got him the success he is known for today.Nick Earned Millions through his days on the band and made good use of the money by investing in many Major League Baseball Teams too. How Rich is Nick Lachey ?Total Net Worth :- $ 22 million (in 2017 as per Forbes)Date Of Birth : November 09, 1973Nick Lachey Height : 5.9 feet or 1.75 mWeight : 76 Kg or 167 lbSpouse : Nick Lachey was first married with with Jessica Simpson but later divorced and now married with Vanessa Lachey . The Surprise on the Wedding NightNick Lachey was once married to the dashing Jessica Simpson but they divorced in early 2006 later Nick met Vanessa Minnillo and the couple got married in 2011 but that didn’t stop the star from letting the world know his feelings about the cost of the wedding, he took to twitter saying that he had no idea how expensive this was going to be, but for certain she is worth it. in our opinion that’s the greatest save because if not for the second part of that sentence we are sure there would be no wedding bells at all.While the real estimate of the marriage was a real secret many speculate that the couple collectively spent close to $900,000 for their special day, so who says money cannot buy happiness.Luxury HouseIts Quite a known fact that before his wedding Nick put his Bel Air Home up on the market, but his intentions were unclear because that was not the first time his house was up for sale. The Mansion is a 4,722 Square foot home with 4 bedrooms and 5 baths. while many say that it was because his then fiancé didn’t want to have to do anything with stuff from his first marriage but that was not the case because he had purchased the mansion right after his divorce in 2006.While they did get a fresh start in their other Encino Home which was worth $2.8 Million the Bel Air Mansion which he purchased for $5.2 Million from the super beautiful Heidi Klum was not sold even then.Nick also owns several cars his favourite is a Custom BMW645 Ci which Nick is pretty attached to, though he can go for cars that are much more expensive he still loves his sports and muscle cars.Nick is truly among Hollywood royalty that have extraordinary business sense and thanks to that he is certainly going to get richer. <SP> Jon Secada <S> tv.actor ratings.rated_entity people.person music.songwriter music.musician music.lyricist music.composer music.artist media_common.cataloged_instance internet.social_network_user film.actor event.performer event.agent broadcast.artist biology.organism award.winner award.nominee award.competitor music.producer tv.personality <S> Grammy-award winning singer/songwriter.

In the early months of 1941, Italy's offensive had been stalled and a Greek counter-offensive pushed into Albania. Germany sought, by deploying troops to Romania and Bulgaria, to aid Italy by attacking Greece from the east; while the British landed troops and aircraft to shore up Greek defences. A coup d'état in Yugoslavia on 27 March caused Hitler to order the conquest of that country. The invasion of Yugoslavia by Germany and Italy began on 6 April, simultaneously with the new Battle of Greece. On 11 April, Hungary joined the invasion. By 17 April the Yugoslavs had signed an armistice and by 30 April all of mainland Greece was under German or Italian control. On 20 May Germany invaded Crete by air and by 1 June all remaining Greek and British forces on the island had surrendered. Although it had not participated in the attacks in April, Bulgaria occupied parts of both Yugoslavia and Greece shortly thereafter for the remainder of the war in the Balkans.

This dramatic change alienated some of his fan-base, who were expecting a result similar to his previous effort Spin. The title of the album is derived from lyrics featured in the second track, I Like the Way.

His parents were Russian Jews. His father, Morris (Moishe) Gershowitz, changed his family name to 'Gershvin' some time after immigrating to the United States from St. Petersburg, Russia in the early 1890s. Gershwin's mother Rosa Bruskin had already immigrated from Russia. She met Gershowitz in New York and they married on July 21, 1895.[2] (George changed the spelling of the family name to 'Gershwin' after he became a professional musician; other members of his family followed suit.)#R##N##R##N#George Gershwin was the second of four children.[3] He first displayed interest in music at the age of ten, when he was intrigued by what he heard at his friend Maxie Rosenzweig's violin recital.[4] The sound and the way his friend played captured him. His parents had bought a piano for lessons for his older brother Ira, but to his parents' surprise and Ira's relief, it was George who played it.[5] Although his younger sister Frances Gershwin was the first in the family to make money from her musical talents, she married young and devoted herself to being a mother and housewife. She gave up her performing career, but settled into painting for another creative outlet — painting was also a hobby of George Gershwin.#R##N##R##N#Gershwin tried various piano teachers for two years, and then was introduced to Charles Hambitzer by Jack Miller, the pianist in the Beethoven Symphony Orchestra. Until Hambitzer's death in 1918, he acted as Gershwin's mentor. Hambitzer taught Gershwin conventional piano technique, introduced him to music of the European classical tradition, and encouraged him to attend orchestra concerts.[6] At home, following such concerts, young Gershwin would attempt to reproduce at the piano the music that he had heard. He later studied with classical composer Rubin Goldmark and avant-garde composer-theorist Henry Cowell.#R##N##R##N#[edit] Tin Pan Alley#R##N##R##N##TAB##R##N##R##N#Swanee#R##N##R##N#Play sound#R##N##R##N#Al Jolson's hit 1920 recording of George Gershwin and Irving Caesar's 1919 Swanee.#R##N##R##N#Problems listening to this file? See media help.#R##N##R##N#At the age of fifteen, George left school and found his first job as a performer, song plugger for Jerome H. Remick and Company, a publishing firm on New York City's Tin Pan Alley, where he earned $15 a week. His first published song was When You Want 'Em You Can't Get 'Em, When You've Got 'Em, You Don't Want 'Em. It was published in 1916 when Gershwin was only 17 years old and earned him $5. His 1917 novelty rag Rialto Ripples was a commercial success, and in 1919 he scored his first big national hit with his song Swanee with words by Irving Caesar. In 1916, Gershwin started working for Aeolian Company and Standard Music Rolls in New York, recording and arranging. He produced dozens, if not hundreds, of rolls under his own and assumed names. (Pseudonyms attributed to Gershwin include Fred Murtha and Bert Wynn.) He also recorded rolls of his own compositions for the Duo-Art and Welte-Mignon reproducing pianos. As well as recording piano rolls, Gershwin made a brief foray into vaudeville, accompanying both Nora Bayes and Louise Dresser on the piano.[7]#R##N##R##N#In the early 1920s Gershwin frequently worked with the lyricist Buddy DeSylva. Together they created the experimental one-act jazz opera Blue Monday set in Harlem, which is widely regarded as a forerunner to the groundbreaking Porgy and Bess.#R##N##R##N#In 1924, George and Ira Gershwin collaborated on a musical comedy Lady Be Good, which included such future standards as Fascinating Rhythm and Oh, Lady Be Good!.[8]#R##N##R##N#This was followed by Oh, Kay! (1926),[9] Funny Face (1927),[10] Strike Up the Band (1927 and 1930),[11] Show Girl (1929),[12] Girl Crazy (1930),[13] which introduced the standard I Got Rhythm; and Of Thee I Sing (1931),[14] the first musical comedy to win a Pulitzer Prize.#R##N##R##N#[edit] Classical music, opera, ballet, and European influences#R##N##R##N#In 1924, Gershwin composed his first major classical work, Rhapsody in Blue for orchestra and piano. It was orchestrated by Ferde Grofé and premiered by Paul Whiteman's concert band in New York. It proved to be his most popular work.#R##N##R##N#Gershwin stayed in Paris for a short period of time during which he applied to study composition with the famous instructor Nadia Boulanger whom, along with several other prospective tutors such as Maurice Ravel, rejected him, being afraid that rigorous classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style.[15] While there, Gershwin wrote An American in Paris. This work received mixed reviews upon its first performance at Carnegie Hall on December 13, 1928, but it quickly became part of the standard repertoire in Europe and the United States.[16] Growing tired of the Parisian musical scene, Gershwin returned to the United States.#R##N##R##N#In 1929, Gershwin was contracted by Fox Film Corporation to compose the score for the movie Delicious. Only two pieces were used in the final film, the five-minute Dream Sequence and the six-minute Manhattan Rhapsody. Gershwin became infuriated when the rest of the score was rejected by Fox Film Corporation, and it would be seven years before he worked in Hollywood again.#R##N##R##N#His most ambitious composition was Porgy and Bess (1935). Gershwin called it a folk opera, and it is now widely regarded as the most important American opera of the twentieth century. Based on the novel Porgy by DuBose Heyward, the action takes place in the fictional all-black neighborhood of Catfish Row in Charleston, South Carolina. With the exception of several minor speaking roles, all of the characters are black. The music combines elements of popular music of the day, with a strong influence of Black music, with techniques typical of opera, such as recitative, through-composition and an extensive system of leitmotifs. Porgy and Bess contains some of Gershwin's most sophisticated music, including a fugue, a passacaglia, the use of atonality, polytonality and polyrhythm, and a tone row. Even the set numbers (of which Summertime, I Got Plenty o' Nuttin' and It Ain't Necessarily So are well known examples) are some of the most refined and ingenious of Gershwin's output. For the performances, Gershwin collaborated with Eva Jessye, whom he picked as the musical director. One of the outstanding musical alumnae of Western University in Kansas, she had created her own choir in New York and performed widely with them.#R##N##R##N#After Porgy and Bess, Gershwin eventually was commissioned by RKO Pictures in 1936 to compose songs and the underscore for Shall We Dance, starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Gershwin's extended score, which would marry ballet with jazz in a new way, runs over an hour in length. It took Gershwin several months to write and orchestrate it.#R##N#Hollywood and early death#R##N#Early in 1937, Gershwin began to complain of blinding headaches and a recurring impression that he was smelling burned rubber. Doctors discovered he had developed a type of cystic malignant brain tumor known as glioblastoma multiforme.[17] Although some tried to trace his disease to a blow on the head from a golf ball, the cause of this type of cancer is still unknown. It occurs most often in males, accounts for 52% of all brain cancers, and is nearly always fatal.#R##N##R##N#The diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme has been questioned.[18] The surgeon's description of Gershwin's tumor as a right temporal lobe cyst with a mural nodule is much more consistent with a pilocytic astrocytoma, a very low grade of brain tumor.[19] Further, Gershwin's initial olfactory hallucination (the unpleasant smell of burning rubber) was in 1934. It is highly unlikely that a glioblastoma multiforme would cause symptoms of that duration prior to causing death. Pilocytic astrocytomas may cause symptoms for twenty or more years prior to diagnosis. Thus, it is possible that Gershwin's prominent chronic gastrointestinal symptoms (which he called his composer's stomach) were a manifestation of temporal lobe epilepsy caused by his tumor.[20] If this is correct, then[original research?] Gershwin was not a notorious hypochondriac, as suggested by his biographer Edward Jablonski.[21]#R##N##R##N#In January 1937, Gershwin performed in a special concert of his music with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra under the direction of French maestro Pierre Monteux.[22]Gershwin suffered 'musical blackouts during his final performances. It was in Hollywood, while working on the score of The Goldwyn Follies, that he collapsed. He died on July 11, 1937 at the age of 38 at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital following surgery for the tumor.[23] John O'Hara remarked: George Gershwin died on July 11, 1937, but I don't have to believe it if I don't want to. [24] A memorial concert was held at the Hollywood Bowl on September 8, 1937 at which Otto Klemperer conducted his own orchestration of the second of Gershwin's Three Piano Preludes.[25]#R##N##R##N#Gershwin received his sole Academy Award nomination, for Best Original Song, at the 1937 Oscars, for They Can't Take That Away from Me written with his brother Ira for the 1937 film Shall We Dance.[26] The nomination was posthumous; Gershwin died two months after the film's release.#R##N##R##N#Gershwin had a ten-year affair with composer Kay Swift and frequently consulted her about his music. Oh, Kay was named for her.[27] After Gershwin died, Swift arranged some of his music, transcribed some of his recordings, and collaborated with his brother Ira on several projects.[28]#R##N##R##N#George Gershwin's mausoleum in Westchester Hills Cemetery#R##N##R##N#Gershwin died intestate. All his property passed to his mother.[29] He is buried in the Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.[30] The Gershwin estate continues to collect significant royalties from licensing the copyrights on Gershwin's work. The estate supported the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act because its 1923 cutoff date was shortly before Gershwin had begun to create his most popular works. The copyrights on all Gershwin's solo works expired at the end of 2007 in the European Union, based on the life plus 70 years rule in force in the EU.#R##N##R##N#In 2005, The Guardian determined using estimates of earnings accrued in a composer's lifetime that George Gershwin was the wealthiest composer of all time.[31]#R##N##R##N#[edit] Legacy and honors#R##N#* The 1945 biographical film Rhapsody in Blue starred Robert Alda as Gershwin. * George Gershwin was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006. * The George Gershwin Theatre on Broadway is named after him.[32] * The George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Musical Achievement Award was established by UCLA to honor the brothers for their contribution to music and for their gift to UCLA of the fight song Strike Up the Band for UCLA. Past winners have included Angela Lansbury (1988), Ray Charles (1991), Mel Torme (1994), Bernadette Peters (1995), Frank Sinatra (2000), Stevie Wonder (2002), k.d. lang (2003), James Taylor (2004), Babyface (2005), Burt Bacharach (2006), Quincy Jones (2007), Lionel Richie (2008) and Julie Andrews (2009). * The Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to George and Ira Gershwin in 1985. Only two other songwriting recipients, Harry Chapin and Irving Berlin, have had the honor of receiving this award.[33][34] Musical style and influence#R##N#Much has been made of his debt to African-American music, and it is indeed a major source of his inspiration, but it's not the only one.[35] Gershwin was influenced by French composers of the early twentieth century. In turn Maurice Ravel was impressed with Gershwin's abilities, commenting, Personally I find jazz most interesting: the rhythms, the way the melodies are handled, the melodies themselves. I have heard of George Gershwin's works and I find them intriguing.[36] The orchestrations in Gershwin's symphonic works often seem similar to those of Ravel; likewise, Ravel's two piano concertos evince an influence of Gershwin.#R##N##R##N#Gershwin asked to study with Ravel. When Ravel heard how much Gershwin earned, Ravel replied with words to the effect of, You should give me lessons. (Some versions of this story feature Igor Stravinsky rather than Ravel as the composer; however Stravinsky confirmed that he originally heard the story from Ravel.)[37]#R##N##R##N#Gershwin's own Concerto in F was criticized for being related to the work of Claude Debussy, more so than to the expected jazz style. The comparison did not deter Gershwin from continuing to explore French styles. The title of An American in Paris reflects the very journey that he had consciously taken as a composer: The opening part will be developed in typical French style, in the manner of Debussy and Les Six, though the tunes are original.[38]#R##N##R##N#Aside from the French influence, Gershwin was intrigued by the works of Alban Berg, Dmitri Shostakovich, Igor Stravinsky, Darius Milhaud, and Arnold Schoenberg. He also asked Schoenberg for composition lessons. Schoenberg refused, saying I would only make you a bad Schoenberg, and you're such a good Gershwin already.[39] (This quote is similar to one credited to Maurice Ravel during Gershwin's 1928 visit to France — Why be a second-rate Ravel, when you are a first-rate Gershwin?)#R##N##R##N#Russian Joseph Schillinger's influence as Gershwin's teacher of composition (1932–1936) was substantial in providing him with a method of composition. There has been some disagreement about the nature of Schillinger's influence on Gershwin. After the posthumous success of Porgy and Bess, Schillinger claimed he had a large and direct influence in overseeing the creation of the opera; Ira completely denied that his brother had any such assistance for this work. A third account of Gershwin's musical relationship with his teacher was written by Gershwin's close friend Vernon Duke, also a Schillinger student, in an article for the Musical Quarterly in 1947.[40]#R##N##R##N#What set Gershwin apart was his ability to manipulate forms of music into his own unique voice. He took the jazz he discovered on Tin Pan Alley into the mainstream by splicing its rhythms and tonality with that of the popular songs of his era. Although George Gershwin would seldom make grand statements about his music, he believed that true music must reflect the thought and aspirations of the people and time. My people are Americans. My time is today.[41]#R##N##R##N#In 2007, the Library of Congress named their Prize for Popular Song after George and Ira Gershwin. Recognizing the profound and positive effect of popular music on culture, the prize is given annually to a composer or performer whose lifetime contributions exemplify the standard of excellence associated with the Gershwins. On March 1, 2007, the first Gershwin Prize was awarded to Paul Simon.[42]#R##N#Recordings and film#R##N#Early in his career Gershwin made dozens of player piano piano roll recordings, which were a main source of income for him. Many are of popular music of the period and others are of his own works. Once his musical theatre-writing career took precedence, his regular roll-recording sessions dwindled. He did record additional rolls throughout the 1920s, including a complete version of his Rhapsody in Blue.#R##N##R##N#Compared to the piano rolls, there are few accessible audio recordings of Gershwin's playing. His first recording was his own Swanee with the Fred Van Eps Trio in 1919. The recorded balance highlights the banjo playing of Van Eps, and the piano is overshadowed. The recording took place before Swanee became famous as an Al Jolson specialty in early 1920.#R##N##R##N#Gershwin did record an abridged version of Rhapsody in Blue with Paul Whiteman and his orchestra for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1924, soon after the world premiere. Gershwin and the same orchestra made an electrical recording of the abridged version for Victor in 1927. However, a dispute in the studio over interpretation angered Paul Whiteman and he left. The conductor's baton was taken over by Victor's staff conductor Nathaniel Shilkret.[43]#R##N##R##N#In 1925, Gershwin sat down at the keyboard of an Aeolean Duo-Art Weber reproducing piano and created an exact record — note for note, pause for pause, inflection for inflection — of his famous Rhapsody in Blue. The inspiration for the piece came to him during a train journey to Boston, with its steely rhythms, its rattlety-bang . . . I suddenly heard - and even saw on paper - the complete construction of the rhapsody from beginning to end. I heard it as a sort of musical kaleidoscope of America - of our vast melting pot, of our unduplicated national pep, of our blues, our metropolitan madness.[41] This piano and the recording survive today and can be heard several times per day at the Music House Museum[44] located near Traverse City, Michigan.#R##N##R##N#Gershwin made a number of solo piano recordings of tunes from his musicals, some including the vocals of Fred and Adele Astaire, as well as his Three Preludes for piano. In 1929, Gershwin supervised the world premiere recording of An American in Paris with Nathaniel Shilkret and the Victor Symphony Orchestra. Gershwin's role in the recording was rather limited, particularly because Shilkret was conducting and had his own ideas about the music. When it was realized no one had been hired to play the brief celeste solo, Gershwin was asked if he could and would play the instrument, and he agreed. Gershwin can be heard, rather briefly, on the recording during the slow section.#R##N##R##N#Gershwin appeared on several radio programs, including Rudy Vallee's, and played some of his compositions. This included the third movement of the Concerto in F with Vallee conducting the studio orchestra. Some of these performances were preserved on transcription discs and have been released on LP and CD.#R##N##R##N#In 1934, in an effort to earn money to finance his planned folk opera, Gershwin hosted his own radio program titled Music by Gershwin. The show was broadcast on the NBC Blue Network from February to May and again in September through the final show on December 23, 1934. He presented his own work as well as the work of other composers.[45] Recordings from this and other radio broadcasts include his Variations on I Got Rhythm, portions of the Concerto in F, and numerous songs from his musical comedies. He also recorded a run-through of his Second Rhapsody, conducting the orchestra and playing the piano solos. Gershwin recorded excerpts from Porgy and Bess with members of the original cast, conducting the orchestra from the keyboard; he even announced the selections and the names of the performers. In 1935 RCA Victor asked him to supervise recordings of highlights from Porgy and Bess; these were his last recordings.#R##N##R##N#A 74-second newsreel film clip of Gershwin playing I've Got Rhythm has survived, filmed at the opening of the Manhattan Theater (now The Ed Sullivan Theater) in August 1931.[46] There are also silent home movies of Gershwin, some of them shot on Kodachrome color film stock, which have been featured in tributes to the composer. In addition, there is newsreel footage of Gershwin playing Madamoselle from New Rochelle and Strike Up the Band on the piano during a Broadway rehearsal of the 1930 production of Strike Up the Band. The comedy team of Clark and McCullough are seen conversing with Gershwin, then singing as he plays.#R##N##R##N#In 1965, Movietone Records released an album MTM 1009 featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of the titled George Gerswhin plays RHAPSODY IN BLUE and his other favorite compositions. The flip side of the LP featured 9 other recordings.#R##N##R##N#In 1975, Columbia Records released an album featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of the Rhapsody In Blue, accompanied by the Columbia Jazz Band playing the original jazz-band accompaniment, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas. The flip side of the Columbia Masterworks release features Tilson Thomas leading the New York Philharmonic in An American In Paris.

After carving a place for itself in war-torn 17th century Europe, the modern town of Grantville, West Virginia continues its quest for survival. A Grantville resident helps Russia modernize, but he in turn must deal with 1600s Russian culture and politics—or wind up dead.#R##N#1636. Grantville has bounced back and established its new mission and identity, but it seems some have been left behind—people like Bernie Zeppi, courageous in the battle, but unable to figure out what to do with himself in a world that’s utterly changed. Then Russian emissary Vladimir Gorchacov arrives in Grantville and hires Bernie to journey to Moscow and bring the future to a Russia mired in slavish serfdom and byzantine imperial plots. Bernie jumps at the chance. He figures it to be an easy gig, complete with high pay and hot-and-cold running women.#R##N#But one thing Bernie hasn’t counted on is the chance to find his purpose in Mother Russia, from fighting the needless death of children from typhoid to building the first dirigible in Russian history. And then there’s love. Just as Bernie realizes his feeling for a certain Russian noblewoman may have gone way beyond respect, he finds them both enmeshed in the deadly politics of Kremlin power struggles.#R##N#Comprehensive Teacher's Guide available. <SP> 1635: The Papal Stakes <S> award.ranked_item book.written_work media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.creative_work ratings.rated_entity book.book <S> 1635: The Eastern Front (The 1632 Universe) by Eric Flint#R##N##R##N##R##N#The New Novel in the New York Times Best-Selling Series.

This local war began the Balkans Campaign of World War II between the Axis powers and the Allies. It turned into the Battle of Greece when British and German ground forces intervened early in 1941. <SP> Balkans Campaign <S> military.conflict time.event book.subject media_common.subject <S> The Balkan Campaign of World War II began with the Italian invasion of Greece on 28 October 1940. In the early months of 1941, Italy's offensive had been stalled and a Greek counter-offensive pushed into Albania. Germany sought, by deploying troops to Romania and Bulgaria, to aid Italy by attacking Greece from the east; while the British landed troops and aircraft to shore up Greek defences. A coup d'état in Yugoslavia on 27 March caused Hitler to order the conquest of that country. The invasion of Yugoslavia by Germany and Italy began on 6 April, simultaneously with the new Battle of Greece. On 11 April, Hungary joined the invasion. By 17 April the Yugoslavs had signed an armistice and by 30 April all of mainland Greece was under German or Italian control. On 20 May Germany invaded Crete by air and by 1 June all remaining Greek and British forces on the island had surrendered. Although it had not participated in the attacks in April, Bulgaria occupied parts of both Yugoslavia and Greece shortly thereafter for the remainder of the war in the Balkans.

Laswell ranks among the most prolific of modern musicians, being involved in hundreds of recordings with many collaborators from all over the world. Laswell's music draws upon many different genres, most notably funk, various world music, jazz, dub and ambient styles. He has also played or produced music from the noisier, more aggressive end of the rock spectrum, such as hardcore punk and metal. According to music critic Chris Brazier, Laswell's pet concept is 'collision music' which involves bringing together musicians from wildly divergent but complementary spheres and seeing what comes out. The credo of one record label run by Laswell, and which typifies much of his work, is Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted. Though projects arranged by Laswell may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically: Material began as a noisy dance music project, but subsequent releases have been centered on hip hop, jazz, or backing spoken word readings by beat generation icon William S. Burroughs.

What is the name of an event similar to battle of seattle? <EOS> Puget Sound War <EOS> Take place at where? <SP> Battle of Seattle <S> time.event military.conflict <S> The Battle of Seattle was a January 26, 1856 attack by native Americans upon Seattle, Washington. At the time, Seattle was a settlement in the Washington Territory that had recently named itself after Chief Seattle, a leader of the Suquamish and Duwamish peoples of central Puget Sound. Backed by artillery fire and supported by Marines from the United States Navy sloop-of-war Decatur, anchored in Elliott Bay, the settlers suffered only two deaths. It is not known if any of the Native American raiders died, though Phelps writes that they later would admit to 28 dead and 80 wounded. The battle, part of the multi-year Puget Sound War or Yakima War, lasted a single day. <SP> Puget Sound War <S> time.event military.conflict <S> The Puget Sound War was an armed conflict that took place in the Puget Sound area of the state of Washington in 1855–56, between the United States military, local militias and members of the Native American tribes of the Nisqually, Muckleshoot, Puyallup, and Klickitat. Another component of the war, however, were raiders from the Haida and Tlingit who came into conflict with the United States Navy during contemporaneous raids on the native peoples of Puget Sound. Although limited in its magnitude, territorial impact and losses in terms of lives, the conflict is often remembered in connection to the 1856 Battle of Seattle and to the wrongful execution of a central figure of the war, Nisqually Chief Leschi. The contemporaneous Yakima War may have been responsible for some events of the Puget Sound War, such as the Battle of Seattle, and it is not clear that the people of the time made a strong distinction between the two conflicts.

She was one of the first artists to introduce <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/fauvism>Fauvism</a> to China, and was known for applying Western painting style to Chinese traditional subjects. Her most famous work is Portrait of Miss L. (1929). Although an art world favorite during the late 1920s and the 1930s, she stopped painting after the onset of the Cultural Revolution and became mostly forgotten in Communist China. ; ;Guan was born in Shanghai in 1903, during the tumultuous late Qing dynasty. She was of Nanhai, Guangdong ancestry. Her parents, who were successful textile merchants involved in textile design, gave her an artistic education from a young age. She studied painting at Shanghai Shenzhou Girls' School and later Western painting at China Art University (中華藝術大學) in Shanghai, where she was taught by the well known painters Chen Baoyi (陳抱一) and Hong Ye (洪野). ; ;After her graduation in 1927, she followed Chen's advice and went to Japan to further her studies. She enrolled at Bunka Gakuin in Tokyo, and her style became strongly influenced by <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse>Henri Matisse</a>'s <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/fauvism>Fauvism</a>. In the 1920s and the 1930s, Chinese women who had successful careers in Japan attracted significant attention from the Japanese media. Guan made headlines as a representative of the modern girl and was projected as a model beauty. ; ;Guan returned to Shanghai in 1930, and became one of the first artists to bring Fauvism to China. She and her fellow female painter Pan Yuliang became favourites in the art world of the young Republic of China (1912–49). Women artists trained in Western style, such as Guan and Pan, captured the fascination of the public, and were accepted as the embodiment of modernity. Her paintings and portraits were repeatedly published in the popular magazine Liangyou (The Young Companion).

He began painting in his late teens. In 1893, he studied with a painter named Henri Rigalon on the Île de Chatou. In 1894 he married Suzanne Berly.

In 1963, their enormous popularity first emerged as Beatlemania; as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the band were integral to pop music's evolution into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.

Where is river source of river bann <EOS> Mourne Mountains <EOS> What is the currency used in this country? <SP> River Bann <S> geography.river geography.body_of_water location.location geography.geographical_feature <S> The River Bann (Irish: an Bhanna, from ban-dea, meaning goddess; Ulster-Scots: Bann Wattèr) is the longest river in Northern Ireland, its length, Upper and Lower Bann combined, being 129 km (80 mi). However, the total length of the River Bann, including its path through the 30 km (19 mi) long Lough Neagh is 159 km (99 mi). Another length of the River Bann given is 90 mi. The river winds its way from the southeast corner of Northern Ireland to the northwest coast, pausing in the middle to widen into the enormous Lough Neagh. The River Bann catchment has an area of 5,775 km². The River Bann has a mean discharge rate of 92 m³/s. According to C.Michael Hogan, the Bann River Valley is a settlement area for some of the first human arrivals in Ireland after the most recent glacial retreat. The river has played an important part in the industrialisation of the north of Ireland, especially in the linen industry. Today salmon and eel fisheries are the most important economic features of the river. The river is often used as a dividing line between the eastern and western areas of Northern Ireland, often labelled the Bann divide. Towns, councils and businesses west of the Bann are often seen as having less investment and government spending than those to the east. It is also seen as a religious, economic and political divide, with Catholics and Irish nationalists being in the majority to the west, and Ulster Protestants and unionists in the majority to the east; and with the financial and industrial capital of Greater Belfast to the east with the west of the Bann being more agricultural and rural. <SP> Mourne Mountains <S> geography.geographical_feature geography.mountain_range location.location protected_sites.listed_site travel.tourist_attraction <S> The Mourne Mountains (/mɔːrn/ MORN; Irish: na Beanna Boirche), also called the Mournes or Mountains of Mourne, are a granite mountain range in County Down in the south-east of Northern Ireland. It includes the highest mountains in Northern Ireland and the province of Ulster. The highest of these is Slieve Donard at 850 m (2,790 ft). The Mournes is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and has been proposed as the first national park in Northern Ireland. The area is partly owned by the National Trust and sees a large number of visitors every year. The name Mourne (historically spelt Morne) is derived from the name of a Gaelic clann or sept called the Múghdhorna.

In 1895 Derain began to study on his own, contrary to claims that meeting <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/maurice-de-vlaminck>Vlaminck</a> or <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse>Matisse</a> began his efforts to paint, and occasionally went to the countryside with an old friend of <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne>Cézanne</a>'s, Father Jacomin along with his two sons. In 1898, while studying to be an engineer at the Académie Camillo, he attended painting classes under <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-carriere>Eugène Carrière</a>, and there met Matisse. In 1900, he met and shared a studio with <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/maurice-de-vlaminck>Maurice de Vlaminck</a> and together they began to paint scenes in the neighbourhood, but this was interrupted by military service at Commercy from September 1901 to 1904. Following his release from service, Matisse persuaded Derain's parents to allow him to abandon his engineering career and devote himself solely to painting, subsequently Derain attended the <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/acad-mie-julian>Académie Julian</a>. ; ;Derain and Matisse worked together through the summer of 1905 in the Mediterranean village of Collioure and later that year displayed their highly innovative paintings at the Salon d'Automne. The vivid, unnatural colors led the critic Louis Vauxcelles to derisively dub their works as les Fauves, or the wild beasts, marking the start of the <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/fauvism>Fauvist</a> movement. In March 1906, the noted art dealer Ambroise Vollard sent Derain to London to produce a series of paintings with the city as subject. In 30 paintings (29 of which are still extant), Derain presented a portrait of London that was radically different from anything done by previous painters of the city such as <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/james-mcneill-whistler>Whistler</a> or <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet>Monet</a>. With bold colors and compositions, Derain painted multiple pictures of the Thames and Tower Bridge. These London paintings remain among his most popular work. Art critic T.G Rosenthal: Not since Monet has anyone made London seem so fresh and yet remain quintessentially English. Some of his views of the Thames use the Pointillist technique of multiple dots, although by this time, because the dots have become much larger, it is rather more simply the separation of colours called <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/divisionism>Divisionism</a> and it is peculiarly effective in conveying the fragmentation of colour in moving water in sunlight. ; ;In 1907 art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler purchased Derain's entire studio, granting Derain financial stability. He experimented with stone sculpture and moved to Montmartre to be near his friend <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso>Pablo Picasso</a> and other noted artists. Fernande Olivier, Picasso's mistress at the time, described Derain as: ; ;At Montmartre, Derain began to shift from the brilliant Fauvist palette to more muted tones, showing the influence of <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism>Cubism</a> and <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne>Paul Cézanne</a>. (According to Gertrude Stein, there is a tradition that Derain discovered and was influenced by African sculpture before the Cubists did.) Derain supplied woodcuts in <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/na-ve-art-primitivism>primitivist</a> style for an edition of Guillaume Apollinaire's first book of prose, L'enchanteur pourrissant (1909). He displayed works at the Neue Künstlervereinigung in Munich in 1910, in 1912 at the secessionist Der Blaue Reiter and in 1913 at the seminal Armory Show in New York.

His mother was a seamstress as well as an actress and his father was a baritone who sang in restaurants. Both Charles and his sister waited on tables where he performed. He delivered his first poetic recital while just a toddler. Within a few years later he had developed such a passion for singing/dancing, that he sold newspapers to earn money for lessons. He took his first theatrical bow in the play Emil and the Detectives at age 9 and within a few years was working as a movie extra. He eventually quit school and toured France and Belgium as a boy singer/dancer with a traveling theatrical troupe while living the bohemian lifestyle. A popular performer at the Paris' Club de la Chanson, it was there that he was introduced in 1941 to the songwriter Pierre Roche. Together they developed names for themselves as a singing/writing cabaret and concert duo (Roche and Aznamour). A Parisian favorite, they became developed successful tours outside of France, including Canada. In the post WWII years Charles began appearing in films again, one of them as a singing croupier in Adieu chérie (1946). Eventually Aznavour earned a sturdy reputation composing street-styled songs for other established musicians and singers, notably Édith Piaf, for whom he wrote the French version of the American hit Jezebel. Heavily encouraged by her, he toured with her as both an opening act and lighting man. He lived with Piaf out of need for a time not as one of her many paramours. His mentor eventually persuaded him to perform solo (sans Roche) and he made several successful tours while scoring breakaway hits with the somber chanson songs Sur ma vie and Parce que and the notable and controversial Après l'amour. In 1950, he gave the bittersweet song Je Hais Les Dimanches [I Hate Sundays] to chanteuse Juliette Gréco, which became a huge hit for her. In the late 50s, Aznavour began to infiltrate films with more relish. Short and stubby in stature and excessively brash and brooding in nature, he was hardly leading man material but embraced his shortcomings nevertheless. Unwilling to let these faults deter him, he made a strong impressions with the comedy Une gosse 'sensass' (1957) and with Paris Music Hall (1957). He was also deeply affecting as the benevolent but despondent and ill-fated mental patient Heurtevent in Head Against the Wall (1959). A year later, Aznavour starred as piano player Charlie Kohler/Edouard Saroyan in 'Francois Truffaut''s adaptation of the David Goodis' novel Shoot the Piano Player (1960) [Shoot the Piano Player], which earned box-office kudos both in France and the United States. This sudden notoriety sparked an extensive tour abroad in the 1960s. Dubbed the Frank Sinatra of France and singing in many languages (French, English, Italian, Spanish, German, Russian, Armenian, Portuguese), his touring would include sold-out performances at Carnegie Hall (1964) and London's Albert Hall (1967). Aznavour served as actor and composer/music arranger for many films, including Gosse de Paris (1961), which he also co-wrote with director Marcel Martin, and the dramas Three Fables of Love (1962) [Three Fables of Love) and Caroline chérie (1968) [Dear Caroline]. The actor also embraced the title role in the TV series Les Fables de la Fontaine (1964), then starred in the popular musical Monsieur Carnaval (1965), in which he performed his hit song La bohême. His continental star continued to shine and Aznavour acted in films outside of France with more dubious results. While the sexy satire Candy (1968), with an international cast that included Marlon Brando, Richard Burton and Ringo Starr, and epic adventure The Adventurers (1970) were considered huge misfires upon release, it still showed Aznavour off as a world-wide attraction. While he was also seen in the English drama _Games, The (1970), _Blockhouse, The (1973) and an umpteenth film version of Agatha Christie's Ein Unbekannter rechnet ab (1974) [And Then There Were None/Ten Little Indians], it was his music that kept him in the international limelight. Later films included Yiddish Connection (1986), which he co-wrote and provided music, and Il maestro (1990) with Malcolm McDowell; more recently he received kudos for his participation in the Canadian-French production Ararat (2002). Films aside, hus chart-busting single She (1972-1974) went platinum in Britain. He also received thirty-seven gold albums in all. His most popular song in America, Yesterday When I Was Young has had renditions covered by everyone from Shirley Bassey to Julio Iglesias. In 1997, Aznavour received an honorary César Award. He has written three books, the memoirs Aznavour By Aznavour (1972), the song lyrics collection Des mots à l'affiche (1991) and a second memoir Le temps des avants (2003). A Farewell Tour was instigated in 2006 at age 82 and, health permitting, could last to 2010. Married at least three times (some claim five) to Micheline Rugel, Evelyne Plessis and Ulla Thorsell, he is the father of six children (daughters Katia, Patricia and Seda Aznavour, and sons Misha, Nicholas and Patrick Aznavour). <SP> Johnny Hallyday <S> award.competitor award.nominee award.winner biology.deceased_organism biology.organism film.actor media_common.cataloged_instance music.artist music.composer music.musician people.deceased_person people.person ratings.rated_entity tv.actor tv.personality event.agent <S> Johnny Hallyday was born on June 15, 1943 in Paris, France as Jean-Philippe Léo Smet.

He quit school at the age of 17 to join the Navy. His naval career was ended following a motorcycle accident while on shore leave in 1955. Shortly thereafter he heard an up and coming singer named Elvis Presley and decided on a singing career of his own. His excellent voice helped to hook him up with Norfolk disk jockey Tex Davis who pushed him through to Capitol Records where he recorded the million selling Be-Bop-A-Lula in 1956. While his first record earned him several movie appearances including The Girl Can't Help It (1956) and Hot Rod Gang (1958) and helped him to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, his success was short lived. His original Blue Caps band broke up fairly quickly and his fame in America dwindled as rebellious rockers of the 1950s were replaced by clean cut teen idols of the early 1960s. Vincent moved to Britain where he was a cult figure in 1959 and remained there for a decade when he returned to America in 1969 with a new record deal and enjoyed a brief revival amongst the hippy teenagers in California who revered him as a legend. His new found fame was cut short by his death on October 12, 1971 at the age of 36 years following complications of a bleeding ulcer and seizure. He had been married four times and was a reputed hard drinker which most likely caused his death. <SP> the Beatles <S> film.subject award.competitor award.hall_of_fame_inductee award.nominee award.winner biology.organism book.author book.subject broadcast.artist cvg.computer_game_subject event.agent film.music_contributor internet.social_network_user media_common.cataloged_instance media_common.subject music.artist music.group music.lyricist music.producer organization.founder ratings.rated_entity tv.actor <S> The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.

The central characters in season one are Dean Cain as Clark Kent/Superman, Teri Hatcher as Lois Lane, Lane Smith as Perry White, Eddie Jones as Jonathan Kent, K Callan as Martha Kent, Michael Landes as Jimmy Olsen, Tracy Scoggins as Catherine Cat Grant and John Shea as Lex Luthor. The first season was a moderate success, garnering the cast, especially Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain, critical praise for their performances.

About 30,000 people disappeared, many of whom were impossible to formally report due to the nature of state terrorism. The justification for the Dirty War was the armed actions of the Montoneros and the ERP. From 1969 to 1979, there were 239 kidnappings and 1,020 murders by the guerrillas. Therefore, the targets were students, militants, trade unionists, writers, journalists, artists and anyone suspected to be a left-wing activist, included Peronist guerrillas. The disappeared (victims kidnapped, tortured and murdered whose bodies were disappeared by the military government) included those thought to be politically or ideologically a threat to the military junta even vaguely, or contrary to the plan of neoliberal economic policies dictated by Operation Condor.; They were killed in an attempt by the junta to silence the social and political opposition.

In his book Lives of the Artists <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari>Giorgio Vasari</a> wrote that Uccello was obsessed by his interest in perspective and would stay up all night in his study trying to grasp the exact vanishing point. While his contemporaries used perspective to narrate different or succeeding stories, Uccello used perspective to create a feeling of depth in his paintings. His best known works are the three paintings representing the battle of San Romano, which were wrongly entitled the Battle of Sant' Egidio of 1416 for a long period of time. ; ;Paolo worked in the <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/international-gothic>Late Gothic</a> tradition, emphasizing colour and pageantry rather than the classical realism that other artists were pioneering. His style is best described as idiosyncratic, and he left no school of followers. He has had some influence on twentieth-century art and literary criticism (e.g., in the Vies imaginaires by Marcel Schwob, Uccello le poil by Antonin Artaud and O Mundo Como Ideia by Bruno Tolentino). ; ;The sources for Paolo Uccello’s life are few: <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari>Giorgio Vasari</a>’s biography, written 75 years after Paolo’s death, and a few contemporary official documents. Due to the lack of sources, even his date of birth is questionable. It is believed that Uccello was born in Pratovecchio in 1397, and his tax declarations for some years indicate that he was born in 1397, but in 1446 he claimed to be born in 1396. His father, Dono di Paolo, was a barber-surgeon from Pratovecchio near Arezzo, his mother, Antonia, was a high-born Florentine. His nickname Uccello came from his fondness for painting birds. ; ;From 1412 until 1416 he was apprenticed to the famous sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti. Ghiberti was the designer of the doors of the Florence Baptistery and his workshop was the premier centre for Florentine art at the time. Ghiberti's late-Gothic, narrative style and sculptural composition greatly influenced Paolo. It was also around this time that Paolo began his lifelong friendship with <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello>Donatello</a>. In 1414, Uccello was admitted to the <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/guild-of-saint-luke>painters' guild</a>, Compagnia di San Luca, and just one year later, in 1415, he joined the official painter's guild of Florence Arte dei Medici e degli Speziali. Although the young Uccello had probably left Ghiberti's workshop by the mid 1420s, he stayed on good terms with his master and may have been privy to the designs for Ghiberti's second set of Baptistery doors, The Gates of Paradise. These featured a battle scene that might well have impressed itself in the mind of the young Uccello, and thus influenced The Battle of San Romano. ; ;According to <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari>Vasari</a>, Uccello’s first painting was a Saint Anthony between the saints Cosmas and Damianus, a commission for the hospital of Lelmo. Next, he painted two figures in the convent of Annalena. Shortly afterwards, he painted three frescoes with scenes from the life of Saint Francis above the left door of the Santa Trinita church. For the Santa Maria Maggiore church, he painted a fresco of the Annunciation. In this fresco, he painted a large building with columns in perspective. According to Vasari, people found this to be a great and beautiful achievement because this was the first example of how lines could be expertly used to demonstrate perspective and size. As a result, this work became a model for artists who wished to craft illusions of space in order to enhance the realness of their paintings.

A trained classical pianist, he often combined darkly humorous and cynical observations with heartfelt romantic sentiments and biting social satire. He is considered one of the best lyricists in songwriting and his interest in the literary world has led to friendships with many writers, including Hunter S. Thompson, Carl Hiaasen, Stephen King, Thomas McGuane and Dave Barry. His breakthrough as a recording artist came in 1978 when his song Werewolves of London became a surprise hit, pushing the accompanying album Excitable Boy into the Top 30 as well. This album, like the preceding and critically praised eponymous album, were produced by Jackson Browne, who helped Warren get a recording contract and stayed a lifelong supporter and friend. Though considered by the general public as a one-hit wonder - an impression not helped by Werewolves of London becoming a hit once more in 1986 following its use by Martin Scorsese in a key scene of The Color of Money - he had a highly praised recording career, a devoted fan-base and a lot of peer respect during the course of the publication of 15 solo albums from 1969 to 2002. He was considered part of the L.A. Mellow Mafia (including, among others, The Eagles, Linda Ronstadt and JD Souther), but set himself apart by his adventurous lyrical and musical choices. He was, however, engaged in the Hollywood lifestyle favored by some of his more high-profile colleagues and was battling with alcoholism for the better part of his life. In the 1990s Warren also branched out into acting, playing himself in episodes of The Larry Sanders Show and Suddenly Susan or acting alongside one-time neighbour and friend Billy Bob Thornton. In 2001 Zevon was diagnosed as terminally ill with mesothelioma, a rare form of lung cancer. He used his last months to record a last album, The Wind. This process was the subject of a VH1 documentary, published posthumously on DVD. <SP> Lindsey Buckingham <S> award.competitor award.nominee biology.organism broadcast.artist celebrities.celebrity event.agent film.actor film.music_contributor internet.social_network_user media_common.cataloged_instance music.artist music.composer music.guitarist music.lyricist music.musician music.producer ratings.rated_entity tv.actor people.person tv.personality <S> Lindsey Buckingham net worth: Lindsey Buckingham is an American guitarist, singer, composer and producer who has a net worth of $80 million.

Along with Maurice Ravel, he was one of the most prominent figures working within the field of impressionist music, though he himself intensely disliked the term when applied to his compositions. In France, he was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1903. A crucial figure in the transition to the modern era in Western music, he remains one of the most famous and influential of all composers. His music is noted for its sensory component and for not often forming around one key or pitch. Often Debussy's work reflected the activities or turbulence in his own life. In French literary circles, the style of this period was known as symbolism, a movement that directly inspired Debussy both as a composer and as an active cultural participant.#R##N##R##N#Orchestral compositions by Claude Debussy#R##N##R##N#L 83, Three Scènes au crépuscule (1892–1893) L 86, Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune (1894) L 91, Nocturnes (with female choir in Sirènes) (1897–1899) Nuages Fêtes Sirènes L 107, Le roi Lear (1904) L 109, La mer (1903–1905) L 122, Images, Set 3 Gigues (1909–1912) Ibéria (1905–1908) Par les rues et par les chemins Les parfums de la nuit Le matin d'un jour de fête Rondes de printemps (1905–1909) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Debussy#R##N##R##N#Claude-Achille Debussy (French: [klod aʃil dəbysi]; 22 August 1862 – 25 March 1918) was a French composer. Along with Maurice Ravel, he was one of the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music, though he himself disliked the term when applied to his compositions. He was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in his native France in 1903. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed.#R##N##R##N#Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of nontraditional tonalities. The prominent French literary style of his period was known as Symbolism, and this movement directly inspired Debussy both as a composer and as an active cultural participant.#R##N##R##N#Early life#R##N##R##N#Debussy was born Achille-Claude Debussy (he later reversed his forenames) on 22 August 1862 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France, the oldest of five children. His father, Manuel-Achille Debussy, owned a china shop there; his mother, Victorine Manoury Debussy, was a seamstress. The family moved to Paris in 1867, but in 1870 Debussy's pregnant mother fled with Claude to his paternal aunt's home in Cannes to escape the Franco-Prussian War. Debussy began piano lessons there at the age of seven with an Italian violinist in his early 40s named Jean Cerutti; his aunt paid for his lessons. In 1871 he drew the attention of Marie Mauté de Fleurville, who claimed to have been a pupil of Frédéric Chopin. Debussy always believed her, although there is no independent evidence to support her claim. His talents soon became evident, and in 1872, at age ten, Debussy entered the Paris Conservatoire, where he spent the next 11 years. During his time there he studied composition with Ernest Guiraud, music history/theory with Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray, harmony with Émile Durand, piano with Antoine François Marmontel, organ with César Franck, and solfège with Albert Lavignac, as well as other significant figures of the era. He also became a lifelong friend of fellow student and distinguished pianist Isidor Philipp. After Debussy's death, many pianists sought Philipp's advice on playing Debussy's works.#R##N##R##N#Musical development#R##N##R##N#Debussy was experimental from the outset, favoring dissonances and intervals that were not taught at the Academy. Like Georges Bizet, he was a brilliant pianist and an outstanding sight reader, who could have had a professional career had he so wished. The pieces he played in public at this time included sonata movements by Beethoven, Schumann and Weber, and Chopin's Ballade No. 2, a movement from the Piano Concerto No. 1, and the Allegro de concert.#R##N##R##N#During the summers of 1880, 1881, and 1882, Debussy accompanied Nadezhda von Meck, the wealthy patroness of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, as she travelled with her family in Europe. The young composer's many musical activities during these vacations included playing four-hand pieces with von Meck at the piano, giving music lessons to her children, and performing in private concerts with some of her musician friends. Despite von Meck's closeness to Tchaikovsky, the Russian master appears to have had minimal effect on Debussy. In September 1880 she sent Debussy's Danse bohémienne for Tchaikovsky's perusal. A month later Tchaikovsky wrote back to her: It is a very pretty piece, but it is much too short. Not a single idea is expressed fully, the form is terribly shriveled, and it lacks unity. Debussy did not publish the piece, and the manuscript remained in the von Meck family; it was eventually sold to B. Schott's Sohne in Mainz, and published by them in 1932.#R##N##R##N#A greater influence was Debussy's close friendship with Marie-Blanche Vasnier, a singer he met when he began working as an accompanist to earn some money, embarking on an eight-year affair together. She and her husband, Parisian civil servant Henri, gave Debussy emotional and professional support. Henri Vasnier introduced him to the writings of influential French writers of the time, which gave rise to his first songs, settings of poems by Paul Verlaine (the son-in-law of his former teacher Mme. Mauté de Fleurville).#R##N##R##N#As the winner of the 1884 Prix de Rome with his composition L'enfant prodigue, Debussy received a scholarship to the Académie des Beaux-Arts, which included a four-year residence at the Villa Medici, the French Academy in Rome, to further his studies (1885–1887). According to letters to Marie-Blanche Vasnier, perhaps in part designed to gain her sympathy, he found the artistic atmosphere stifling, the company boorish, the food bad, and the monastic quarters abominable. Neither did he delight in Italian opera, as he found the operas of Donizetti and Verdi not to his taste. Debussy was often depressed and unable to compose, but he was inspired by Franz Liszt, whose command of the keyboard he found admirable. In June 1885, Debussy wrote of his desire to follow his own way, saying, I am sure the Institute would not approve, for, naturally it regards the path which it ordains as the only right one. But there is no help for it! I am too enamoured of my freedom, too fond of my own ideas!#R##N##R##N#Debussy finally composed four pieces that were sent to the Academy: the symphonic ode Zuleima (based on a text by Heinrich Heine); the orchestral piece Printemps; the cantata La damoiselle élue (1887–1888) (which was criticized by the Academy as bizarre, although it was the first piece in which the stylistic features of Debussy's later style began to emerge); and the Fantaisie for piano and orchestra, which was heavily based on César Franck's music and therefore eventually withdrawn by Debussy. The Academy chided him for courting the unusual and hoped for something better from the gifted student. Although Debussy's works showed the influence of Jules Massenet, Massenet concluded, He is an enigma.#R##N##R##N#During his visits to Bayreuth in 1888–9, Debussy was exposed to Wagnerian opera, which would have a lasting impact on his work. Debussy, like many young musicians of the time, responded positively to Richard Wagner's sensuousness, mastery of form, and striking harmonies. Wagner's extroverted emotionalism was not to be Debussy's way, but the German composer's influence is evident in La damoiselle élue and the 1889 piece Cinq poèmes de Charles Baudelaire. Other songs of the period, notably the settings of Verlaine – Ariettes oubliées, Trois mélodies, and Fêtes galantes – are all in a more capricious style.#R##N##R##N#Around this time, Debussy met Erik Satie, who proved a kindred spirit in his experimental approach to composition and to naming his pieces. Both musicians were bohemians during this period, enjoying the same cafe society and struggling to stay afloat financially.#R##N##R##N#In 1889, at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, Debussy first heard Javanese gamelan music. He incorporated gamelan scales, melodies, rhythms, and ensemble textures into some of his compositions, most notably Pagodes from his piano collection Estampes.#R##N##R##N#Personal life#R##N##R##N#Debussy's private life was often turbulent. At the age of 18 he began an eight-year affair with Marie-Blanche Vasnier, the wife of Parisian civil servant Henri. The relationship eventually faltered following his winning of the Prix de Rome in 1884 and obligatory residence in Rome.#R##N##R##N#On his permanent return to Paris and his parents' home on the rue de Berlin (now rue de Liège) he began a tempestuous relationship with Gabrielle ('Gaby') Dupont, a tailor's daughter from Lisieux, soon cohabiting with her on the rue de Londres, and later the rue Gustave Doré. During this time he also had an affair with the singer Thérèse Roger, to whom he was briefly engaged. Such cavalier behaviour was widely condemned, and precipitated the end of his long friendship with Ernest Chausson.#R##N##R##N#He ultimately left Dupont for her friend Rosalie ('Lilly') Texier, a fashion model whom he married in 1899, after threatening suicide if she refused him. However, although Texier was affectionate, practical, straightforward, and well liked by Debussy's friends and associates, he would become increasingly irritated by her intellectual limitations and lack of musical sensitivity. Moreover, her looks had prematurely aged, and she was unable to bear children.#R##N##R##N#In 1904 Debussy was introduced to Emma Bardac, wife of Parisian banker Sigismond Bardac, by her son Raoul, who was one of his students. In contrast to Texier, Bardac was a sophisticate, a brilliant conversationalist, and an accomplished singer. After dispatching Lilly to her father's home at Bichain in Villeneuve-la-Guyard on 15 July 1904, Debussy secretly took Bardac to Jersey for a holiday. On their return to France, Debussy wrote to Texier on 11 August from Dieppe, informing her that their marriage was over, but still making no mention of Bardac. Debussy briefly moved to an apartment at 10 avenue Alphand. On 14 October, five days before their fifth wedding anniversary, Texier attempted suicide, shooting herself in the chest with a revolver while standing in the Place de la Concorde; she survived, although the bullet remained lodged in her vertebrae for the rest of her life. The ensuing scandal was to alienate Debussy from many of his friends, whilst Bardac was disowned by her family. Debussy's last home, now 23 Square Avenue Foch, Paris#R##N##R##N#In the spring of 1905, finding the hostility towards them intolerable, Debussy and Bardac (now pregnant) fled to England, via Jersey. Bardac's divorce was finalized in May. The couple settled at the Grand Hotel, Eastbourne, from 24 July to 30 August 1905, where Debussy was to correct proofs to his symphonic suite La mer, celebrating his divorce from Texier on 2 August.#R##N##R##N#After a brief visit to London, the couple returned to Paris in September, buying a house in a courtyard development off the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne (now Avenue Foch) where Debussy would reside for the rest of his life. Their daughter (the composer's only child) Claude-Emma was born there on 30 October. Her parents were eventually married in 1908, their troubled union enduring until Debussy's death in 1918. Claude-Emma, more affectionately known as 'Chouchou', was a great musical inspiration to Debussy (she was the dedicatee of his Children's Corner suite); he remarked towards the end of his life, when gravely ill, that were it not for her, he might have committed suicide. Claude-Emma outlived her father by scarcely a year, succumbing to the diphtheria epidemic of 1919 after her doctor administered the wrong treatment.#R##N##R##N#Mary Garden, who played the part of Melisande in the original production of Pelléas et Mélisande in 1902, was to write of him: I honestly don’t know if Debussy ever loved anybody really. He loved his music – and perhaps himself. I think he was wrapped up in his genius... He was a very, very strange man.#R##N##R##N#Death#R##N##R##N#Debussy died of rectal cancer at his Paris home on 25 March 1918, at the age of 55. He had been diagnosed with the cancer in 1909 after experiencing haemorrhaging, and in December 1915 underwent one of the earliest colostomy operations ever performed. The operation achieved only a temporary respite, and occasioned him considerable frustration (he was to liken dressing in the morning to all the labours of Hercules in one). His death occurred in the midst of the aerial and artillery bombardment of Paris during the German Spring Offensive of World War I. The funeral procession made its way through deserted streets to Père Lachaise Cemetery as the German guns bombarded the city. The military situation in France was critical, and did not permit the honour of a public funeral with ceremonious graveside orations. Debussy's body was reinterred the following year in the small Passy Cemetery sequestered behind the Trocadéro, fulfilling his wish to rest 'among the trees and the birds'; his wife and daughter are buried with him.#R##N##R##N#Music#R##N##R##N#Style#R##N##R##N#Rudolph Reti points out the following features of Debussy's music, which established a new concept of tonality in European music:#R##N#Glittering passages and webs of figurations which distract from occasional absence of tonality; Frequent use of parallel chords which are in essence not harmonies at all, but rather 'chordal melodies', enriched unisons, described by some writers as non-functional harmonies; Bitonality, or at least bitonal chords; Use of the whole-tone and pentatonic scale; Unprepared modulations, without any harmonic bridge.#R##N#He concludes that Debussy's achievement was the synthesis of monophonic based melodic tonality with harmonies, albeit different from those of harmonic tonality.#R##N##R##N#The application of the term Impressionist to Debussy and the music he influenced is a matter of intense debate within academic circles. One side argues that the term is a misnomer, an inappropriate label which Debussy himself opposed. In a letter of 1908 he wrote: I am trying to do 'something different' — an effect of reality... what the imbeciles call 'impressionism', a term which is as poorly used as possible, particularly by the critics, since they do not hesitate to apply it to [J.M.W.] Turner, the finest creator of mysterious effects in all the world of art. The opposing side argues that Debussy may have been reacting to unfavorable criticism at the time, and the negativity that critics associated with Impressionism; it could therefore be argued that he would have been pleased with application of the current definition of Impressionism to his music.#R##N##R##N#List of works#R##N##R##N#Early works#R##N##R##N#From the 1890s Debussy began to develop his own musical language which was largely independent of Wagner's style, coloured in part from the dreamy, sometimes morbid, romanticism of the Symbolist movement. Debussy became a frequent participant at Stéphane Mallarmé's Symbolist gatherings, where Wagnerism dominated the discussion. However, in contrast to the enormous works of Wagner and other late-romantic composers around this time, Debussy chose to write in smaller, more accessible forms.#R##N##R##N#The Deux arabesques is an example of one of Debussy's earliest works, already developing his musical language. Suite bergamasque (1890) recalls rococo decorousness with a modern cynicism and puzzlement, and contains one of Debussy's most popular pieces, Clair de Lune. Debussy's String Quartet in G minor (1893) paved the way for his later more daring harmonic exploration, using the Phrygian mode as well as less standard scales such as the whole-tone, which creates a sense of floating, ethereal harmony. Debussy was beginning to employ a single, continuous theme, breaking away from the traditional A-B-A form with its restatements and amplifications, which had been a mainstay of classical music since Haydn.#R##N##R##N#Debussy wrote one of his most famous works under the influence of Mallarmé, the revolutionary Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, which is truly original in form and execution. In contrast to the large orchestras so favoured by late-romanticism, Debussy wrote this piece for a smaller ensemble, emphasizing instrumental colour and timbre. Despite Mallarmé himself and colleague and friend Paul Dukas having been impressed by the piece, it was controversial at its premiere, but nevertheless established Debussy as one of the leading composers of the era.#R##N##R##N#Middle works#R##N##R##N#The three Nocturnes (1899) include characteristic studies: in Nuages, using veiled harmony and texture; Fêtes, in exuberance; and Sirènes, using whole-tones. Debussy's only complete opera Pelléas et Mélisande premiered in 1902, after ten years of work, and contrasted sharply with Wagnerian opera. Based on the play by Maurice Maeterlinck, the opera proved to be an immediate success and immensely influential to younger French composers, including Maurice Ravel. These works brought a fluidity of rhythm and colour quite new to Western music.#R##N##R##N#La mer (1903–1905) essays a more symphonic form, with a finale that works themes from the first movement, although the middle movement, Jeux de vagues, proceeds much less directly and with more variety of colour. The reviews were once again sharply divided. Some critics thought the treatment to be less subtle and less mysterious than his previous works, and even a step backward, with Pierre Lalo complaining I neither hear, nor see, nor feel the sea. Others extolled its power and charm, its extraordinary verve and brilliant fantasy, and its strong colors and definite lines.#R##N##R##N#Debussy wrote much for the piano during this period. The set of pieces entitled Pour le piano (1901) uses rich harmonies and textures which would later prove important in jazz music. His first volume of Images pour piano (1904–1905) combines harmonic innovation with poetic suggestion: Reflets dans l'eau is a musical description of rippling water, whilst second piece Hommage à Rameau is slow and yearningly nostalgic, taking a melody from Jean-Philippe Rameau's 1737 Castor et Pollux as its inspiration.#R##N##R##N#The evocative Estampes for piano (1903) give impressions of exotic locations. Debussy came into contact with Javanese gamelan music during the 1889 Paris Exposition Universelle. Pagodes is the directly inspired result, aiming for an evocation of the pentatonic structures employed by Javanese music.#R##N##R##N#Debussy wrote his famous Children's Corner Suite (1908) for his beloved daughter, Claude-Emma, whom he nicknamed Chouchou. The suite recalls classicism — the opening piece Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum refers to Muzio Clementi's collection of instructional piano compositions Gradus ad Parnassum — as well as a new wave of American ragtime music. In the popular final piece of the suite, Golliwogg's Cakewalk, Debussy also pokes fun at Richard Wagner by mimicking the opening bars of Wagner's prelude to Tristan und Isolde.#R##N##R##N#The first book of Préludes (1910), twelve in total, proved to be his most successful work for piano. The Preludes are frequently compared to those of Chopin. Debussy's preludes are replete with rich, unusual and daring harmonies. They include the popular La fille aux cheveux de lin (The Girl with the Flaxen Hair) and La Cathédrale Engloutie (The Engulfed Cathedral), although since Debussy wanted people to respond intuitively to these pieces, their titles were placed at the end of each one in the hope that listeners would not make stereotype images as they listened.#R##N##R##N#Larger scale works included his orchestral piece Iberia (1907), a triptych medley of Spanish allusions and fleeting impressions which was begun as a work for two pianos, and also the music for Gabriele D'Annunzio's mystery play Le martyre de Saint Sébastien (1911). A lush and dramatic work, written in only two months, it is remarkable in sustaining a late antique modal atmosphere that otherwise was touched only in relatively short piano pieces.#R##N##R##N#As Debussy gained in popularity, he was often engaged as a conductor throughout Europe during this period, most often performing Pelléas, La Mer, and Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune. He was also an occasional music critic, to supplement his conducting fees and piano lessons, writing under the pseudonym Monsieur Croche. Debussy avoided analytical dissection and attempts to force images from music, saying Let us at all costs preserve this magic peculiar to music, since of all the arts it is most susceptible to magic. He could be caustic and witty, sometimes sloppy and ill-informed. Debussy was for the most part enthusiastic about Richard Strauss and Stravinsky, and worshipful of Chopin and Bach, the latter being acknowledged as the one great master. His relationship to Beethoven was a complex one; he was said to refer to him as le vieux sourd (the old deaf one) and adjured one young pupil never to play Beethoven's music for it is like somebody dancing on my grave. It was said that Debussy liked Mozart, and he believed that Beethoven had terrifically profound things to say, but that he did not know how to say them, because he was imprisoned in a web of incessant restatement and of German aggressiveness. He also admired the works of Charles-Valentin Alkan. Schubert and Mendelssohn fared much worse, the latter being described as a facile and elegant notary.#R##N##R##N#Late works#R##N##R##N#Debussy's harmonies and chord progressions frequently exploit dissonances without any formal resolution. Unlike in his earlier work, he no longer hides discords in lush harmonies, and the forms are far more irregular and fragmented. These chords that seemingly had no resolution were described by Debussy himself as floating chords, and were used to set tone and mood in many of his works. The whole tone scale dominates much of Debussy's late music.#R##N##R##N#His two final volumes of works for the piano, the Études (1915), interpret similar varieties of style and texture purely as pianistic exercises, and include pieces that develop irregular form to an extreme, as well as others influenced by the young Igor Stravinsky (a presence too in the suite En blanc et noir for two pianos, 1915). The rarefaction of these works is a feature of the last set of songs, the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé (1913), and of the Sonata for flute, viola and harp (1915), though the sonata and its companions also recapture the inquisitive Verlainian classicism.#R##N##R##N#With the sonatas of 1915–1917 there is a sudden shift in the style. These works recall Debussy's earlier music in part, but also look forward, with leaner, simpler structures. Despite the thinner textures of the Violin Sonata (1917), there remains an undeniable richness in the chords themselves. This shift parallels the movement commonly known as neo-classicism, which became popular after Debussy's death in 1918. Debussy planned a set of six sonatas, but had only completed three (cello, flute-viola-harp, and violin) before he died.#R##N##R##N#The final orchestral work by Debussy, the ballet Jeux (1912) written for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, contains some of his strangest harmonies and textures in a form that moves freely over its own field of motivic connection. At first, Jeux was overshadowed by Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which was composed in the same year as Jeux, and was premiered only two weeks later by the same ballet company. Decades later, composers such as Pierre Boulez and Jean Barraqué pointed out parallels to Anton Webern's serialism in this work.#R##N##R##N#Other late stage works, including the ballets Khamma (1912) and La boîte à joujoux (1913), were left with the orchestration incomplete, and were later completed by Charles Koechlin and André Caplet, who also helped Debussy with the orchestration of Gigues (from Images pour orchestre) and Le martyre de St. Sébastien.#R##N##R##N#The second set of Préludes for piano (1913) features Debussy at his most avant-garde, where he uses dissonant harmonies to evoke specific moods and images. Debussy consciously gives titles to each prelude which amplify the preludes' tonal ambiguity and dissonance. He uses scales such as the whole tone scale, musical modes, and the octatonic scale in his preludes which exaggerate this tonal ambiguity, making the key of each prelude almost indistinguishable at times. The second book of Preludes for piano represents Debussy's strong interest in the indefinite and esoteric.#R##N##R##N#Although Pelléas was Debussy's only completed opera, he began several opera projects which remained unfinished, perhaps due to his fading concentration, increasing procrastination, and failing health. He had finished some partial musical sketches and some unpublished libretti for operas based on Poe's The Devil in the Belfry (Le diable dans le beffroi, 1902–?1912) and The Fall of the House of Usher (La chute de la maison Usher, 1908–1917) as well as considering projects for operas based on Shakespeare's As You Like It and Joseph Bedier's La Legende de Tristan.#R##N##R##N#Further plans, such as an American tour, more ballet scores, and revisions of Chopin and Bach works for re-publication, were all cut short by poor health and the outbreak of World War 1.#R##N##R##N#Mathematical structuring#R##N##R##N#Some people have claimed that Debussy structured parts of his music mathematically. Roy Howat, for instance, has published a book contending that Debussy's works are structured around mathematical models even while using an apparent classical structure such as sonata form. Howat suggests that some of Debussy's pieces can be divided into sections that reflect the golden ratio, frequently by using the numbers of the standard Fibonacci sequence.#R##N##R##N#Influences#R##N##R##N#Debussy's influences were wide-ranging. He acquired a taste for parallel motion in fifths, fourths and octaves from medieval music, and an appreciation for figuration and arabesque from the Baroque masters. He especially had a great love for the French clavier composers Couperin and Rameau, as well as J.S. Bach. Chopin and Liszt were also powerful influences, not only in terms of pianistic layout and harmonic ingenuity, but also because of their willingness to create new forms to accommodate their material.#R##N##R##N#Among the Russian composers of his time, the most prominent influences were Tchaikovsky, Balakirev, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and Mussorgsky. It can be inferred that from the Russians Debussy acquired his taste for ancient and oriental modes and for vivid colorations, and a certain disdain for academic rules. Specifically, Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov directly influenced one of Debussy's most famous works, Pelléas et Mélisande. In addition to the Russian composers, one of Debussy's biggest influences was Richard Wagner. According to Pierre Louys, Debussy did not see 'what anyone can do beyond Tristan.'#R##N##R##N#After Debussy's Wagner phase, he started to become immensely interested in non-Western music and its unorthodox approaches to composition. Specifically, he was drawn to the Javanese Gamelan: a musical ensemble from the island of Java that played an array of unique instrumentation, including gongs and metallophones. He first heard the gamelan at the 1889 Paris Exposition. Debussy was not interested in directly quoting his non-Western influences, but instead allowed this non-Western aesthetic to generally influence his own musical work, for example, by frequently using quiet, unresolved dissonances, coupled with the damper pedal, to emulate the shimmering effect created by a gamelan ensemble.#R##N##R##N#Debussy was just as influenced by other art forms as he was by music, if not more so. He took a strong interest in literature and visual art, and used these mediums to help shape his unique musical style. Debussy was heavily influenced by the French symbolist movement of the 1880s, which encompassed poetry, visual art, and theatre. He shared the movement's interest in the esoteric and indefinite and their rejection of naturalism and realism. Specifically, the development of free verse in poetry and the disappearance of the subject or model in painting influenced Debussy to think about issues of musical form. Debussy became personally acquainted with writers and painters of the movement, and based some of his own works on those of the symbolists. The poet Stéphane Mallarmé was a major influence, who in talking of a 'musicalization' of poetry laid claim to a strong connection between music and his own poetry. Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune was directly influenced by Mallarmé's poem Afternoon of a Faun. Like the symbolists in respect to their own art forms, Debussy aimed to reject common techniques and approaches to composition and attempted to evoke more of a sensorial experience for the listener with his works. Since his time at the Paris Conservatoire, Debussy believed he had much more to learn from artists than from musicians, who were primarily interested in their musical careers.#R##N##R##N#Above all, Debussy was inspired by nature and the impression it made on the mind, making a pantheistic profession of faith when he called mysterious Nature his religion. 'I do not practice religion in accordance with the sacred rites. I have made mysterious Nature my religion. I do not believe that a man is any nearer to God for being clad in priestly garments, nor that one place in a town is better adapted to meditation than another. When I gaze at a sunset sky and spend hours contemplating its marvellous ever-changing beauty, an extraordinary emotion overwhelms me. Nature in all its vastness is truthfully reflected in my sincere though feeble soul. Around me are the trees stretching up their branches to the skies, the perfumed flowers gladdening the meadow, the gentle grass-carpeted earth, ... and my hands unconsciously assume an attitude of adoration. ... To feel the supreme and moving beauty of the spectacle to which Nature invites her ephemeral guests! ... that is what I call prayer.'#R##N##R##N#Contemporary painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler (who lived in France for a period of time) had a profound influence on Debussy. In 1894, Debussy wrote to violinist Eugène Ysaÿe describing his Nocturnes as an experiment in the different combinations that can be obtained from one color—what a study in grey would be in painting. Although it is not known what it is meant by this statement, one can observe in his music a careful use of orchestral, textural, and harmonic 'shading'.#R##N##R##N#Influence on later composers#R##N##R##N#Claude Debussy is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. His innovative harmonies were influential to almost every major composer of the 20th century, particularly Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky, Olivier Messiaen, Béla Bartók, Pierre Boulez, Henri Dutilleux, Ned Rorem, George Gershwin, and the minimalist music of Steve Reich and Philip Glass as well as the influential Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu. He also influenced many important figures in jazz, most notably Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Bix Beiderbecke, George Shearing, Thelonious Monk, Bill Evans, Jimmy Giuffre, Antônio Carlos Jobim, Django Reinhardt, and Herbie Hancock. He also had a profound impact on contemporary soundtrack composers such as John Williams, because Debussy's colourful and evocative style translated easily into an emotional language for use in motion picture scores.#R##N##R##N#Eponyms#R##N##R##N#A number of posthumous discoveries bear Debussy's name.

Warrior Within was developed and published by Ubisoft, and released on December 2, 2004 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows. It picks up where The Sands of Time left off, adding new features, specifically, options in combat. The Prince now has the ability to wield two weapons at a time as well as the ability to steal his enemies' weapons and throw them. The Prince's repertoire of combat moves has been expanded into varying strings that allow players to attack enemies with more complexity than was possible in the previous game. Warrior Within has a darker tone than its predecessor adding in the ability for the Prince to dispatch his enemies with various gory finishing moves. In addition to the rewind, slow-down, and speed-up powers from The Sands of Time, the Prince also has a new sand power: a circular wave of sand that knocks down all surrounding enemies as well as damaging them. The dark tone, a vastly increased level of blood and violence as well as sexualized female NPCs earned the game an M ESRB rating.
